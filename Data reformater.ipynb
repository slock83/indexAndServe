secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new western  insights into soviet society. david r. marples\\' new book, his second on the  chernobyl accident of april 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best type of  non-soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo in  moscow official circles.  the author, a british-educated historian and economist, is a research associate  with the canadian institute of ukrainian studies at the university of alberta,  and the academic style of the book is undisguised. however, its intended  audience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power, or  soviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing state  secrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of the  event and its continuing aftermath.  the effects of chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of soviet  society that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible. marples  discusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order (as  indicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the text) and  succeeds in mapping out his main themes. the personal interests of each reader  determine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too  sketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the levels  are generally appropriate.  the book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary might  have been possible in a quarter the length. but, on the other, so many of the  judgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources that the  author is obligated to present the raw data for the reader\\'s inspection. the  modular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and revisit  earlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a thorough  index.  first in the world\\'s attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the human  victims of the accident. the official tally is 31 (only about 20 names have  ever been released), but marples suspects there were other short-term radiation  victims. a large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also performed  on local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties.  widespread \"radiophobia\" led to restricted diets which created malnourishment  and subsequent disease in thousands of people. the tens of thousands of people  taking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals of  those exposed. since the book went to press, soviet military sources have  referred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program.  but the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. here, marples  encounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official soviet  myth-making around the event: reality is twisted to serve state policy  objectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that all is  well when it isn\\'t.  and thus is born what he properly labels the \"myth of chernobyl,\" the official  line that the disaster provided a test that soviet society passed with honor.  \"in the soviet view,\" he writes, \"it was first and foremost a victory, a story  with an ending, and an ending that was triumphant.\"  thus, when sober western medical estimates placed the future \"excess cancer  deaths\" at several tens of thousands, both in the soviet union and in europe (a  few tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the soviets  reacted furiously. the estimates are branded \"nonsense\" and the estimators are  dismissed as \"panic mongers\" promulgating \"anti-soviet venom.\"  subsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact, economic and  political repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations. along the  way, marples provides a damning list of examples in which soviet officials  attempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. false  information was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at the  site, on contamination levels of the kiev water supply, on severe discipline  against non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules and on  operator training levels.  a severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially denied  although it was real enough to compel the restart of three chernobyl reactors  in explicit violation of soviet safety regulations. design deficiencies of the  chernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared to be  the primary culprit.  ultimately, observes the author, \"it is ironic that in an era of openness,  chernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under gorbachev and then  subsequently its first casualty.\" he ultimately concludes, \"aspects of the  disaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly by  soviet sources.\" hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably  fulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties.  the july, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of disclosure.  journalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but the  weeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their  substance has ever been released.  the propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity, he  maintains, had one goal: \"to divert culpability from the party hierarchy, in  kiev and especially in moscow.\" this is precisely the theme i have also  encountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past. where  individual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may eventually  be released, but where kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the nedelin  catastrophe of 1960 or the soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event remains  absolutely off limits to glasnost.  the closing blow-by-blow description of the nuclear power debate presages a  dramatic event which occurred too recently for inclusion in this first edition.  viktor legasov, tagged by the author as one of the country\\'s two leading  pro-nuclear advocates, actually was sinking into private despair over the poor  implementation of safety standards. in the end, he made his final and most  eloquent testimony to this despair on the second anniversary of the accident,  by committing suicide. for several weeks the soviets tried to sit on the  circumstances of his \"tragic death,\" even issuing official non-explanations  which asserted that the death was not due to medical effects of radiation.  finally, crusading journalist vladimir gubarev, with access to legasov\\'s  notebooks, broke the story in pravda. readers of this book will come to know  these and other characters so well that the suicide fits right into the \"big  picture\" of the catastrophe\\'s social impacts.  for an author to so accurately describe a social milieu that subsequent  unpredictable events only enhance his insights is testimony to the highest  quality of scholarship. readers of marples\\' book will rarely be surprised as  the chernobyl catastrophe\\'s consequences continue to unfold in the future.

       "  'text': 'andre jardin\\'s \"tocqueville,\" surprisingly the first full-scale biography of  this major 19th-century figure, is a fine, old-fashioned piece of work, some of  it original, much of it taken from the ample precedent scholarship. it provides  an abundant store of information and an occasional surprise -- a dozen years  after its publication, we find the author of \"democracy in america,\" now  minister of foreign affairs, exclaiming: \"but what animals these americans  are!\"  it is as the author of \"democracy in america\" that tocqueville is known in this  country but what this biography reveals is not so much an admirer of america  as a frenchman of his time, circumstance and needs, even when he is in america.  he came here with his friend beaumont ostensibly as a student of penitentiary  reform, but tocqueville really wanted to take a larger look at this new  republic, since it was clear to him that the european drift was in that  direction, and what intrigued him was its democratic base, since he had been  brought up to believe that a republic could function only when run by a  virtuous elite. we know what he found and how he responded, but the biography  also reveals, almost inadvertently, why he was such an accurate and  comparatively unbiased observer.  for one thing, he had not biased himself by reading contemporary travel  literature, much of it written by snide tories pretending to take an  unprejudiced look at the american experiment. capt. basil hall\\'s infamous  \"travels\" had been only partially translated (the chapter on prison reform)  into french, and, in any event, it was his companion beaumont who read it. the  result was that tocqueville\\'s vision had not been prejudiced (other than by his  relative chateaubriand\\'s romance with new world nature). for another,  tocqueville and beaumont readied themselves each day by preparing questions for  the people they would meet, questions based upon their own observations sur  place and designed to elicit responses useful to them as frenchmen trying to  prepare themselves for a possible future. they were not, as were the tories,  justifying a past.  tocqueville\\'s cartesian clarity, his relative lack of bias, meant that he used  the answers to his questions to form a useful statement about america, but the  questions themselves and their reasons reveal perhaps even more about france.  by looking at this intelligent, open-minded, and inquiring young civil servant  and nobleman of impeccable political parentage (great grandson of malesherbes),  jardin\\'s book provides the american reader a marvelous introduction to the  political shiftings, the gradual yet sometimes violent post-revolutionary  cracking of the political structure in france as it grappled simultaneously  with the shattered legitimacy of the past, a slippery present and an  ill-defined future.  after the immediate success of \"democracy in america\" (1835), tocqueville  entered the political arena and was elected deputy for the arrondissement of  valognes, the region of his family castle in normandy. he sat left of center in  the chamber. although many at the time thought of him as an carlist aristocrat  and some in this country think of him as an american-style conservative,  tocqueville considered the old aristocracy \"dead for ever.\" over the years, he  demonstrated his liberalism by fighting for parliamentary monarchy, separation  of church and state, reform of the suffrage laws, improvement of the worker\\'s  lot, for liberalizing public education, abolishing slavery wherever it existed,  improving the prison system and eliminating poverty. he managed, nevertheless,  to stay clear of several more powerful champions of liberal causes such as  lamartine, royer-collard, and thiers, who would have liked to have him on their  side but whose egos he mistrusted.  independence is what most characterizes tocqueville\\'s career. a colleague  reproached him for \"giving the right hand to the left, the left to the right  and regretting that he does not have a third one to give invisibly.\" \"freedom  is the strongest of my passions. voila. it is the truth,\" he explained to  disconcerted observers. if he moved left, it was, he claimed, to impose his  color on the left, not change his own.  another constant was his hatred of centralization. in \"l\\'ancien regime et la  revolution,\" tocqueville analyzed the roots of centralization in france, which  according to him went as far back as the reign of philip the fair in the middle  ages. he lamented the fact that centralization had destroyed time-tested local  organic structures and that the french nobility itself was at fault in the  process. tocqueville fought centralism in all of its manifestations as he saw  them. for instance, rather an agnostic himself, he defended religious education  because he believed in the healthy necessity of a third force besides the state  and the people.  tocqueville\\'s anticentralism colored his responses to the various colonial  enterprises that characterize european history of the period. thus, in newly  conquered algeria, he favored a kind of settlement based on local autonomy  rather than central metropolitan power. he was the first man in the chamber to  push for a separate ministry for algeria -- a dream that became a fact only a  century later in leon blum\\'s cabinet. he deplored the downfall of the ottoman  empire in the middle east, since the turks were not only a desirable bumper  between the major european predators, but also relatively tolerant themselves  toward the diversity of their possessions. he admired the respect for local  customs that the british had shown in india.  tocqueville was an active, intelligent legislator, esteemed particularly for  his work on penitentiary reform (inspired by the philadelphia system) and on  the abolition of slavery, but he was not a sensational figurehead. one might  say that, like montaigne, he had lived through a great deal of political  turmoil and managed to preserve an independent judgment. when louis-napoleon  was propelled into the presidency at the end of the bloody 1848 revolution,  tocqueville was given the foreign affairs ministry in the barrot cabinet. he  served with the same unsensational distinction as in the chamber but was fired  after only five months. he had protested louis-napoleon\\'s coup d\\'etat that made  an emperor of the president and was briefly imprisoned in vincennes -- luckier  in this than one of our great-grandfathers, who was sent to the sahara for the  same offense. from then to his death from tuberculosis in cannes in 1859,  tocqueville led the life of a gentleman farmer and journalist who, amid  numerous changes of residence to accommodate his health, wrote (but did not  finish) \"l\\'ancien regime et la revolution.\"  this long and scrupulous study of a man who was one of the most profound and  prophetic thinkers of his time, is, alas, scrupulous to the point of boredom.  the narration rarely deviates from an inexhaustible concatenation of facts  related in the soberest of prose. although it does justice to tocqueville\\'s  ideas, it fails in rendering the passion and the grace of his intellectual life  and the social brilliance of the era. moreover, the book is curiously  organized: the order followed a mixture of the chronological and of the  thematic, with several baffling leaps from one to the other. andre jardin\\'s  work constitutes an excellent work of reference for the scholar. it is indexed  and substantially but not cumbersomely footnoted. still it makes the layman  yearn for the livelier manner of much recent historical writing.

       "  'text': 'why read \"tungsten,\" a partisan novel written almost 60 years ago in which evil  is unmitigated, virtue unblemished, and the characters seem to lack dimension  or complexity as they play out their predetermined roles on the stage of the  class struggle? why read a book in which ideology reigns supreme, and why  celebrate its first, belated translation into english? because the author is  cesar vallejo, one of the great poets of the 20th century and a major figure in  latin american literature.  vallejo created a wrenching poetic language for spanish that radically altered  the shape of its imagery and the nature of its rhythms. no facile trend setter,  vallejo forged a new discourse in order to express his own visceral compassion  for human suffering. he saw the world in piercing flashes of outrage and  anguish, terror and pity, and what he saw wounded him like knife thrusts. a  passionate, tragic poet, he mourned our loss of moral innocence and despaired  of the injustice that moves the world. in the late 1920s, when he was living in  paris and eking out a meager livelihood as a journalist, the pain at the roots  of his being found objective substantiation in radical politics.  born in the peruvian andes in 1892, he witnessed firsthand the victimization  and exploitation of the south american indians. although his own family was not  financially destitute (his father was a notary and minor bureaucrat in the  small town of santiago de chuco), vallejo was a cholo, a person born of mixed  european and indian ancestry. the fact is not irrelevant. in a society where  social and economic status followed the color line with cosmic certainty, where  racial discrimination was rigidly adhered to although rarely acknowledged in  public, the representatives of foreign companies, with the wholehearted  complicity of domestic colleagues, extracted high profits from the near-slavery  of the illiterate, utterly alienated and ultimately helpless victims of that  racism. vallejo had ample opportunity to witness the brutalization en masse of  the indian underclass and the appalling greed of their lighter-skinned masters  who carried on the colonial tradition of using indians as forced labor in mines  and on plantations.  twentieth-century writers from ciro alegria to manuel scorza have denounced the  peruvian tragedy in their books. \"tungsten\" was one of the earliest novels to  do so in modern terms. as a young man, however, vallejo\\'s greatest energies  were devoted to writing and publishing his poems (\"los heraldos negros,\" his  first book, appeared in 1918) consequently, he remained on the periphery of  the windstorms of political and social unrest that swept through south america  in the second decade of the century, although he was in the time and place  where growing agitation to establish justice for peruvian indians and workers  began its inexorable march toward marxism.  vallejo, jose carlos mariategui (the \"shining path\" in today\\'s peru takes its  name from his writings) and victor raul haya de la torre (a founder of the  important apra movement -- the \"popular revolutionary american alliance\")  crossed paths at the university in trujillo. but vallejo was an intermittent  student. his family began to experience economic difficulties during his  adolescence, and he was obliged to interrupt secondary school and then his  university studies to take a series of jobs, which included office work in the  mines at tambores and quiruvilca, and on a large sugar plantation in the  chicama valley.  these facts are not irrelevant either. they provided the historical raw  material for \"tungsten,\" the documented background to vallejo\\'s outcry against  the grim realities of indian life in peru. the shape that material would take  -- his conviction that the problem of race was indistinguishable from the  problem of class -- was determined by his increasingly active commitment to  socialism, a political engagement that, by 1930, led to his expulsion from  france, where he had gone to live seven years earlier.  the action of the novel is centered in a fictional mining town and its  provincial capital, colca. the time is 1917, just before the u.s. entry into  world war i when a ready supply of tungsten would be crucial to the weapons  industry. a north american corporation takes over the mine, and the boom is on:  peasants are first lured and then coerced into working for the company, local  indians, the soras, are cheated of their land and animals, petit bourgeois  entrepreneurs scramble on the backs of the poor for wealth and position, and  venal officials and dignitaries find a new source of bribery and  power-brokering in the foreign capitalists. the first two-thirds of the book,  in fact, constitutes a genre study of unashamed thuggery, a series of vignettes  of corruption, repression and brutality that sets the stage for the violent  heart of \"tungsten\" and the appearance of its proletarian indian hero, servando  huanca.  two indian boys are forcibly conscripted into military service (the military as  well as the mining contractors have \"body quotas\" -- numbers of recruits or  workers that must be obtained by any means), and on the long march from their  homes to colca, when they are tied by the waist to the mules that their captors  ride, they are so badly abused that one of them eventually dies. outside the  subprefecture an angry crowd gathers, indignant at the visible signs of the  conscripts\\' mistreatment. one defiant man, servando huanca, steps forward to  speak for the crowd with natural authority and an instinctive class  consciousness. these qualities inspire the people and momentarily cow the  authorities, but then the troops are ordered to fire into the crowd, and later  that night officially sanctioned vigilantes pursue any indian they can find,  shooting to kill. some, however, are taken into custody, and deals are struck  by sleazy officials which allow the prisoners to be sent off to a sure death in  the mines to help fulfill the company\\'s \"body quota.\"  last and certainly least, the third section of the book is a kind of postscript  to the colca massacre. vallejo allows his indignation and passion to turn into  mechanical ideology: servando huanca \"duckspeaks\" a mercifully brief exercise  in orthodoxy, proclaiming that world revolution is under way, that it will be  led by a militant proletariat inspired by lenin and not by bourgeois  \"intellectuals,\" that it will sweep away the ruling classes in peru. vallejo  even permits the novel to end with this ponderously symbolic sentence:  \"outside, the wind was rising, portending storm.\"  kevin j. o\\'connor has written a thoughtful and informative foreword, robert  mezey has done a fine job of translating vallejo\\'s often quirky spanish, and  both of them deserve our gratitude for their sensitivity and skill in bringing  the work to the attention of an english-language audience. i am sorry that i  cannot say as much for the editing. the typographical errors are frequent and  unforgivable, and there is no indication as one reads that mezey has provided  important end notes to the text. this is a disservice to the reader vallejo  and his translator deserve better.

       "  'text': 'when i think of some friends of mine from the old neighborhood (all of whom had  the proper ethnic credentials, let me assure you), one thing i remember is our  wariness of what we called \"i have a problem\" literature. by that, we meant  literature of ethnic experience at its most tiresome: brooding, angst-ridden  story-polemics, crammed to the gills with resentment and righteous anger, about  existential misery in the land of the round-eye literature that seemed to  assume that any bit of drivel was worth your attention just as long as it had a  chip on its shoulder. it\\'s a species related to what calvin trillin called the  \"kvetch novel\" -- any novel in which you want to say to the main character,  \"oh, just pull up your socks\" -- only more irritating. but it\\'s also an easy  trap for anyone who writes from an ethnocentric point of view to fall into. it  is, therefore, to frank chin\\'s credit that his collection of short stories,  \"the chinaman pacific &amp frisco r.r. co.\" by and large avoids this trap even  as it dances on the edge of the pit.  there are eight stories in this volume, most of them autobiographical in tone.  almost all have as their essential subject the alienation of chinese-america  from the america of white skin and wonder bread. the first two, \"railroad  standard time\" and \"the eat and run midnight people,\" read like meandering  stream-of-consciousness memoirs and are self-indulgent enough to make them the  weakest of the bunch. the final story, \"the sons of chan,\" clothes itself in  shreds of fiction with some interesting freudian overtones, but it is otherwise  a tiring screed on growing up with the stereotypes in charlie chan movies as  your only reflection in popular culture. chin\\'s rhetoric is often sharp and  funny, but he also rides the high horse of racial bitterness for more than it\\'s  worth.  it\\'s the other five stories that distinguish \"the chinaman pacific &amp frisco  r.r. co.\" in them, chin displays two considerable writerly virtues. one is a  wicked sense of humor that runs a provocative gamut from jangled whimsy to  scathing satire. his subject matter is weighty enough so that an amusing  conceit or figuration often balances out the mood. this is particularly true of  \"a chinese lady dies,\" in which the narrator\\'s problematic (and disturbingly  oedipal) relationship with his mother evokes such tension that the story would  self-immolate without the whimsical dream passages in which he imagines himself  as an old-western hero called e. chino. his wit feels more like a dagger than a  feather, but is no less amusing for it. and for good measure, chin tacks on an  afterword that reads suspiciously like a freewheeling satire on maxine hong  kingston\\'s \"the woman warrior.\"   his other primary virtue is his considerable skill as a storyteller. he has a  genuine gift for bringing characters and their predicaments alive. one sees  this most vividly in \"the only real day,\" which focuses on the struggle of an  aged immigrant to keep american culture at bay and preserve his identity as a  chinese. chin has a definite point to make in this story about the corrosion of  chinese values and identity in a mostly white world, but the message is  filtered so thoroughly through the plot and well-drawn characters that it has  no didactic harshness. it is, above all, a poignant and entrancing piece of  fiction. \"yes, young daddy,\" which depicts the protagonist\\'s relationship with  a female cousin who is grappling with adolescence, is also worth noting for its  skillful portraiture.  chin\\'s prose style tends toward a looseness vaguely reminiscent of william s.  burroughs. it\\'s lively stuff but also slow going at times, what with the  missing antecedents, plastic sentence structure and all. he also enjoys playing  fast and loose with temporal shifts in his stories, with the result that  memory, present experience, anticipation and pure fantasy often overlap. it\\'s  an absorbingly dense reflection of the way in which past, present and future  come to bear upon each other in the mind, but everything melds so seamlessly  that the reader may have some trouble keeping things sorted.  on the whole, chin does a good job of avoiding the hazards that could have  swallowed up these stories. although alienation is the great theme of  post-world war ii american literature and our age is distinguished by its  voices from outside the mainstream, just because a work is about racial  alienation doesn\\'t automatically make it worth reading. the problem with  ethnocentric literature is that its force is so centripetal. it tends to reach  inward, instead of outward toward the universal significance that, as northrop  frye said, marks literature in its highest form. fiction need not reach that  level to be worth our while, but it should at least show a human dimension that  will move us and provoke us, as mere formalized pique cannot. fortunately, \"the  chinaman pacific &amp frisco r.r. co.\" achieves such transcendance often  enough to make it worthwhile fiction.

       "  'text': \"suddenly popular after nearly a century of neglect, stencil painting now  decorates nursery walls and furniture, living and dining room walls and floors.  stenciling became prominent in europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it  was used to imitate wallpaper. in the american colonies, stenciled designs were  used on floors, on furniture and on canvas or oilcloth floor coverings.  the process is simple: a stenciler, using a craft knife, cuts various shapes in  a piece of sturdy, usually waxed, paper, and then applies paint to a surface  through those cutouts. the beauty of stenciling is the ease of repetition:  complicated swag-and-bouquet borders can be applied to walls in a fraction of  the time (and without the requisite talent) it would take someone to paint them  by hand. stenciling can be a very satisfying craft, because the end result,  when done well, looks professionally neat and precise.  although stenciling is easy enough to attempt on your own -- with just some  paper, a craft knife, paint and brushes -- a small test project before  launching into a total-room experience is a good idea. the hardest thing to  master is the correct consistency of the paint. think dry. and the stencil  brush (shaped like a blunt, long-handled shaving brush) should be wielded with  an up-and-down motion wiping brings disaster. the surface to be stenciled  determines the consistency of the paint cloth can take more paint on the  brush, but a floor previously painted with something like diamond-hard deck  enamel will resist all paint.   many how-to books on stenciling have been published dover books has issued a  series of books of stencil designs on thick paper, ready for cutting.  stenciling supplies and classes are offered at judy's carousel crafts and  rainbow craft, both in burbank, and at craf-t-mac's in la habra. supplies are  available at aaron bros. stores, kit kraft in studio city, stat's in pasadena,  and michael's in torrance. ucla extension plans to offer a stenciling class in  the spring quarter.  \",\n",

general in 1989? the times ran these questions by people in  various walks of life, and here are some of their answers:  muriel siebert, head of the muriel siebert &amp co. discount brokerage in new  york, and first female member of the new york stock exchange:  \"i would like to see certain business practices regulated. i think that the  leveraged buyouts show the greed of people at their worst. . . . the lbos are  bypassing the purpose of the capital-raising system. i think that to the extent  that people were stockholders in these companies . . . they should be allowed  to continue to have some kind of share in the profits (after the leveraged  buyouts) because these moves were done while they were stockholders.  \"must greed be the creed? i would like to see that also rolled over to our  defense contractors. i am pro defense. i believe in a strong country because  people mistake gentility for weakness. if (contractors) cheat on defense  contracts, i don\\'t see why they don\\'t go to jail. . . . i just feel that if you  are a major defense contractor, you owe a fiduciary responsibility to this  country because defense expenditures are putting a pretty big toll on the  country.\"  andrew brimmer, former member of the federal reserve board and head of a  washington economics consulting firm:  \"my leading wish is that the nation deal with the federal budget deficit. i  would like to see a substantial reduction in 1989 and extending over the next  three years. i would strongly recommend that we raise taxes. there should be  some moderation in the level of government expenditures, but the real problem  is the lag in revenue.  \"i also would like to see more done for education by business. the kind of  education i\\'m talking about is at the elementary and secondary level.  businesses are already contributing to colleges. businesses should do likewise  for elementary and secondary schools. business people can play a role as  counselors and teachers. a firm might make available an engineer or  mathematician to go into schools and teach. business should do more to offer  on-the-job training for unskilled, or limited-skills, people, perhaps through a  (lower) learning wage. we would give business tax credits to do this.\"  william r. robertson, executive secretary of the los angeles county federation  of labor, afl-cio:  \"i would like to see a change in philosophy by the incoming president relating  to labor relations and providing for fairness in our (labor) organizing efforts  and contract negotiations. . . .  \"i would also like to see some protection for workers losing their jobs because  of mergers. it is a national disgrace. in too many mergers, the workers are the  ones that suffer and the country as well. something should be done to correct  it. . . .  \"and, finally, this administration should face reality in resolving the  astronomical deficit.\"  steven d. lydenberg, an associate with the \"socially responsible\" investment  firm of franklin research &amp development:  \"there is an increasing interest around the country in social investing. people  want to know not just the financial implications of making a commitment in a  company, but also the social implication. that information is not very easy to  come by.  \"so, if at the end of \\'89 corporations were disclosing in a uniform way their  yield figures, their charitable contribution figures, the numbers of women and  minorities in top management and board directors, their attitude on a number of  comparable social issues, i would be very happy.\"  frank borman, chairman of patlex corp. of chatsworth, former astronaut and  former chairman of eastern airlines:  \"we should begin to move toward taxing consumption -- a value-added tax. this  is quite controversial as al ullman (oregon democrat and former chairman of the  house ways and means committee, who was defeated in 1988 after advocating a  value-added tax) will tell you. but this taxing system is needed. it would  certainly help our exports. almost all of europe is under the value-added  taxing system. also, it may encourage saving instead of consumption. one of the  ways you discourage consumption is to tax it.\"  michael harrington, co-chair of democratic socialists of america and author of  \"the other america\" and \"the new american poverty\":  \"i hope secretary of state baker will build on the basic insights of former  treasury secretary baker (james baker, former treasury secretary, was nominated  by president-elect bush to be secretary of state) that a settlement of third  world debt is in the self-interest of america, opening up markets for business  and labor. but then the new baker will have to go far beyond the old, since  latin america now owes more than it did in 1982 when the crisis officially  began, and several countries, including argentina and brazil, may see democracy  subverted if current trends persist.  \"at home, the nation must recognize that we can\\'t waste young people, and  particularly minorities and women, on illiteracy, unemployment and unproductive  low-wage work. we must invest mightily in education, training and job  generation.\"  alan bromberg, a securities law expert and professor at southern methodist  university:  \"there are several things i would like most to see changed in the economy and  business practices. one, more concentration by business and government, both  here and abroad, on . . . the facilitation of international trade and  investment. this would require wider horizons for business people . . . and  more effort by government to reduce and ultimately eliminate all kinds of  restrictions on the movement of products.  \"two, i would like to see a national consensus developed, preferably in the  form of federal legislation, on corporate takeovers and buyouts that would  recognize the efficiencies and benefits they bring as well as the dislocations  and hardships they can cause. this would involve tax policies and labor polices  and limitations on the ability of states to balkanize corporate law by  different anti-takeover statutes everywhere. (there also should be) some kind  of limitation on management self-entrenchment and self-enrichment.  \"i think we could use a lot of clarification of the securities laws. i think  the courts have done a good job of saying what insider trading is. the kind of  issues that are most difficult are what really is parking (of stock)? how much  cooperation or similar action by different individuals or different groups of  individuals makes it collaboration? these issues haven\\'t been well resolved. .  . .  peter bahouth, executive director of greenpeace in washington:  \"people now view threats to human security less in terms of political threats  and more in environmental and economic terms. so for my wish list, i would ask  first that we deal with the issue of the greenhouse effect. we better develop  some alternative views in mass transportation and cut subsidies to reflect the  true cost of fossil fuels in terms of pollution, along with the actual economic  cost of development. then, we could put more money into research and  development of wind and solar energy.  \"(also on my wish list is) peace on earth. if we want peace on earth, we have  to start looking seriously at the fact that we are making more and more  weapons, and in a process which endangers the health of american people. . . .  production plants have been proven to have released into the air and water  radioactivity and toxic chemicals.\"  \"also, it would be nice if we could learn that the rain forest affects all of  us. we need to preserve it. and we would like the tuna industry to stop killing  dolphins.\"  '},\n",

       "  'text': 'two predictions for 1989: there isn\\'t going to be a bush revolution. but george  bush will have to pay the price for the reagan revolution.  we know there won\\'t be a bush revolution because, with one exception, none of  the people bush has appointed to policy-making positions is a revolutionary.  they are in the mold of secretary of state-designate james a. baker iii, who  was reviled by conservatives when he was ronald reagan\\'s chief of staff atty.  gen. richard thornburgh, who has served in the nixon, ford and reagan  administrations treasury secretary nicholas f. brady, who is closer to wall  street than to the supply-siders on the republican right, and brent scowcroft,  bush\\'s national security adviser, who is known to harbor serious doubts about  reagan\\'s \"star wars\" program. in other words, bush has assembled a team of  cautious, moderate, pragmatic, establishment republicans.  the one exception is jack kemp, bush\\'s proposed secretary of housing and urban  development. kemp has never held an executive position before, and he is  brimming over with radical new ideas. kemp\\'s is regarded as a token appointment  to a secondary cabinet position, however, made to mollify the gop\\'s right wing.  (quiz: who is reagan\\'s secretary of housing and urban development? hint: he is  the only cabinet member who served for reagan\\'s entire two terms. give up?  here\\'s another hint: he is the only black in reagan\\'s cabinet. still stumped?  the answer is samuel r. pierce jr. if you didn\\'t know, don\\'t worry. reagan  himself didn\\'t recognize pierce at a white house reception several years ago.)  actually, radical new ideas are what is needed for dealing with the major  problem under kemp\\'s purview, namely, the national scandal of homelessness.  other than kemp, the only controversial appointments bush has made were to  political rather than policy-making positions -- john h. sununu as white house  chief of staff, lee atwater as republican party chairman and dan quayle as vice  president. none has to be confirmed by the senate. and the bush people are  still trying to figure out something for quayle to do.  otherwise, when it comes to policy positions, there are no james p. watts, no  william j. caseys, no edwin meese iiis, no william j. bennetts. the reagan  administration gave us bold new ideas. the bush administration will give us  something we rarely got from reagan -- professionalism.  congress seems impressed by bush\\'s professionalism. even democrats express  admiration for the professionalism of his presidential campaign. \"it was a  nasty campaign,\" said house majority whip tony coelho (d-merced), \"but  basically it was a professional campaign. they knew what had to be done and  they did it.\"  right now, we are in one of the rare periods of make-nice in washington. bush\\'s  efforts to bind up the wounds of the campaign are paying off. he has bought  himself a honeymoon. conservatives are holding their fire they don\\'t want to  be seen as abandoning the new president before he even takes office. the press  is happy because the president-elect has held more press conferences this year  than the president.  congress and bush are engaged in an elaborate alphonse-and-gaston routine. each  side expresses great admiration for the other. one says, \"oh please, you be the  first to reveal your budget plans.\" \"oh no, i couldn\\'t possibly,\" says the  other. \"please, you go first.\" as in the court of the sun king at versailles,  the ritual courtesy masks a deadly clash of ambitions. each side wants to seize  the dagger and drive it into the other\\'s heart.  taxes are the dagger. he who proposes new taxes gets it in the neck. as sen.  john breaux (d-la.), the new chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign  committee, put it, \"bush is the one who laid down the gauntlet -- read my lips,  no new taxes. if we go out and break his promise for him, we get the blame for  it and he gets the credit. no one wants to fall into that trap.\"  in other words, as soon as the deficit comes up, the honeymoon ends. it will be  hard for bush to do what reagan has done for the last eight years, namely,  pretend the deficit is not his problem.  bush will also pay the price for reagan\\'s foreign policy. in this case, a break  with the republican right is inevitable. the right always resented the fact  that reagan abandoned his \"evil empire\" agenda in order to pursue arms control  and detente. they dared not protest, however. \"reagan could always go over our  heads to our own people at the grass roots,\" said conservative activist paul  weyrich. \"bush won\\'t be able to do that. he needs us.\" bush and scowcroft do  not show much enthusiasm for \"star wars.\" bush and baker have decided to  postpone asking congress for new military aid to the contras. the reagan  administration, with bush\\'s full support, has begun talking to the palestine  liberation organization. some time this year, conservatives are going to say,  \"enough!\"  bush will also pay the price for reagan\\'s social agenda. here the break will be  not with congress or the gop right, but with the american public. it will  happen as soon as the supreme court reverses its historic 1973 roe vs. wade  decision that defined abortion as a constitutionally protected human right.  justice harry a. blackmun, who wrote roe vs. wade, has warned that abortion  rights may soon \"go down the drain.\" four of the nine current supreme court  justices want to overturn the roe decision, and three of roe\\'s supporters are  in their 80s.  roe will go. and when that happens, all hell will break loose. \"taking away  rights that have already been given is a hard thing to pull off,\" said kate  michelman, executive director of the national abortion rights action league.  millions of american women have had abortions. despite increased restrictions,  the abortion rate has remained steady at 1.5 million a year during the reagan  years. a decision recriminalizing abortion will be as divisive for republicans  as the 1954 school desegregation decision was for democrats. reagan was lucky.  he demanded an end to abortions but it didn\\'t happen on his watch. bush won\\'t  be so lucky.

       "  'text': 'go-o-o-d morning, sacramento! californians have some new year\\'s resolutions to  propose:   -- balance proposition 103\\'s attack on soaring insurance premiums with curbs  on claim costs and attorney fees.   -- take responsibility for restructuring the gann spending limit to fit  current budget realities and quit bucking tough fiscal decisions to the voters.   -- address the issues raised by the fbi sting, initiative mania and the  speakership wars by a comprehensive approach to government reform and not  merely cosmetic tinkering.   -- face the critical questions of what the quality of life in california  should be and who should pay for it -- and stop ducking complex issues like  health care, the environment, toxics, transportation, growth controls and  regional government.  how realistic are these resolutions? that\\'s not easy to predict. because what  happens in sacramento in 1989 will depend primarily on gov. george deukmejian,  assembly speaker willie brown and the onslaught of reapportionment.  deukmejian\\'s decision whether or not to seek reelection will influence policy  direction. will he be persuaded to run by advisers who argue he has the best  chance to keep the governor\\'s chair republican and thus prevent a democratic  gerrymander in the 1991 reapportionment?  or, looking toward retirement, will he opt to abandon his stubborn naysaying  and attempt to build a legacy?  early signals are mixed. after mellowing on gann limit revisions, he\\'s again  mulling wholesale budget chopping.  the pledge that speaker brown recently made to ease up on politicking and  concentrate on policy-making could also help chart a positive course for state  government. again, signals are mixed -- in view of the partisan sniping at  deukmejian\\'s nominee for state treasurer by brown\\'s lieutenants.  the speaker\\'s definition of \"doing policy\" is crucial. policy-making is not  selectively taking over legislators\\' bills and ramming them through the  assembly. a \"boutique\" approach to problem-solving is not leadership.  a leader allows lawmakers to nurture their own programs, and then protects  their bills through the entire legislature and the governor\\'s office, too. he  stands up to special interests who fund legislative campaigns and then stymie  legislative action. (in 1989, the real test will be if brown opposes the  state\\'s trial lawyers, key political supporters, for enactment of comprehensive  insurance reform.)  but the strongest influence may be reapportionment. to make policy, legislators  have to get elected, and governors need legislative majorities of their own  party.  will assembly republicans, led by their confrontational leader, ross johnson of  la habra, frustrate policy through partisan, obstructionist games designed to  wound the democratic majority before reapportionment?  will dissident legislative democrats quiet down in exchange for a \"kinder,  gentler\" redistricting?  will incumbents and leaders of both parties opt to play it safe -- and not risk  any new policy initiatives before reapportionment can assure their continued  political survival?  who can predict whether 1989 will bring an end to sacramento\\'s political  gridlock? the denizens of the state capitol might prefer to hibernate until  reapportionment season. but perhaps, as assemblyman richard katz of sepulveda  speculated, \"if more solutions don\\'t start coming out of this place, then no  one will be around for reapportionment.\"  if this prediction doesn\\'t stir some resolve in sacramento, nothing will.

       "  'text': 'was the decision to make rome the capital of italy, taken in the last century,  a mistake even bigger than the colosseum itself?  yes, says luigi firpo, a history professor at turin university and one of the  luminaries among italian intelligentsia. his opinion has probably been held by  millions of other italians since rome actually became the italian capital in  1870. it is an opinion likely to gain adherents in the next century.  many romans, or those who call themselves romans, agree that the eternal city  seems each day less likely to hold on to that defiant label much longer. for  them, rome entered an alarming new chapter around ad 1950, the year when  everyone who could switched from bicycles to cars, and folks flocked in from  the hills to join the roman circus.  firpo, who now also sits in parliament, has said that the degradation of rome  is total. the romans are vulgar, arrogant and ignorant, he claims, and the city  \"does not deserve to be the capital.\" for him, rome is \"the only levantine city  without a european quarter.\"  his remarks, uttered first in parliament then repeated and expanded in  interviews, brought a denial from his political party that he was speaking for  them, and then angry words from the city\\'s political bosses. some of their  responses were impoverished, falling back on the line that rome was the natural  capital because it once had been the capital of the western world.  this, firpo said, was \"imperial rhetoric.\" harking back to the empire was also  one of benito mussolini\\'s gambits, when the italian dictator was playing from  his balcony to cheering roman crowds. mussolini spoke of his rome as being the  city\\'s third incarnation. first, the rome of the caesars, then the rome of the  popes and finally the rome of his glorious new fascist regime.  prince metternich, the 19th-century austrian statesman, dismissed the italy of  his time as being \"more a geographical expression than a country.\" a little  later, firpo\\'s native piedmont, the northwestern italian region that borders  switzerland and france, produced a handful of noblemen who thought that italy  should become a unified nation for the first time since the fall of the roman  empire. in 1861 the piedmontese parliament declared that one day rome would be  the new italian capital. the rest of the country was then under foreign  domination rome and other parts of italy were ruled by the pope.  when the kingdom of italy was proclaimed in turin, one unification supporter,  the marquis massimo d\\'azeglio, said, \"we\\'ve created an italy -- now we must  create the italians.\" a strong argument could be made that his second goal is  still a long way off.  to relieve the pope of his temporal powers, the piedmontese entered rome on  sept. 20, 1870, set up their king in what until the day before had been the  pope\\'s residence and found themselves in possession of a city of fewer than  200,000 people, living in a poverty unknown elsewhere on the italian peninsula.  today rome\\'s official population is 3 million, but each day it continues to  attract migrants from hill towns and farms, drawn like moths to the bright  lights. they soon find themselves living in shantytowns on the outskirts,  without electricity or even plumbing. the arches of roman aqueducts, built  2,000 years ago to supply water for nero\\'s baths, are now bricked up by  migrants and serve as dwellings.  a cover story on a feisty italian weekly, espresso, some time ago was titled,  \"when the capital is corrupt -- the nation is infected.\" that was, and probably  is, the attitude of milan or any other modern metropolitan area in northern  italy toward the nation\\'s capital. each year the northern regions see their tax  payments shipped to rome for distribution in favor of southern italy, an area  just as rich in natural resources as the north and with double the  unemployment.  alberto moravia, the dean of italian novelists, now a spry 83, is a rome  native. he was one of the first to jump on firpo for his remarks, reminding him  that when the piedmontese entered rome, they demolished many splendid buildings  and private gardens to make rome \"more modern.\" a few days later, moravia  recalled that he himself had written against rome a few years back and offered  proof that firpo was not all that original in his thoughts.  moravia had said: \"rome is not worthy of the name of being a european capital,  like paris or london. it is not a model for the nation to follow, but a sterile  bureaucratic sponge that absorbs everything and gives nothing. though the  center of the church, it is the world\\'s least spiritual city. religion is  present more with its bureaucracy than with its sentiment . . . . there is no  circulation of ideas and persons in rome, meaning there is no society of  either.\"  when firpo was asked where he would prefer to have the italian capital, he  said, \"somewhere near chiusi, but in open country.\" both he and moravia agree  that chiusi -- an old etruscan town midway between rome and florence -- is only  their utopian dream. it is too late for an italian pretoria, canberra, brasilia  or washington, even though with their cars, italy\\'s central government and the  entire elephantine bureaucracy are destroying the remains of both ancient and  modern rome with a wanton thoroughness that would give pause to attila the hun.  if it had not been deemed necessary to dislodge the pope from his temporal  control over rome, some of the piedmontese were touting naples as the nation\\'s  capital. it was, after all, the largest italian city and still a major cultural  influence in europe. however, the sicilians said they would never again accept  naples as a sovereign seat.  what a pity. the neapolitans have been living by their wits for centuries. they  are clever about inventing jobs and pulling rabbits out of other peoples\\' hats.  they are nimble, too, as people who choose to live under a smoldering volcano  need to be. they have produced great painters, poets, composers, writers,  architects -- while rome has failed to produce even one.  had naples become the italian capital 100 years ago, it would have tilted the  scale in favor of the italian peninsula becoming a mediterranean country, not  what it is now -- an angry mix, half-european and half-mediterranean.  that is what luigi firpo\\'s rage against rome is all about. he spoke for  millions of italians who consider themselves european, and, incidentally,  probably spoke also for foreign europeans who must do business in italy and who  find themselves beating their heads against the city\\'s bureaucratic rubber  wall.  the only way out of this italian dilemma is for the north to secede from the  union. both sides would be winners.

       "  'text': 'eight years of socially and economically devastating war with u.s.-backed  contra forces -- topped off 10 weeks ago by the most destructive hurricane in  decades -- have sucked much of the substance but not the spirit from  nicaragua\\'s 3.6 million people.  a few years ago nicaraguans talked enthusiastically of government campaigns to  reduce infant mortality, eradicate malaria, distribute land to the landless and  wipe out illiteracy.  for a while great strides were made toward realizing those goals. but today,  for the first time since the revolution that overthrew dictator anastasio  somoza in 1979, children beg on the streets as government officials reluctantly  slash health programs that once drew international praise.  in an effort to help hundreds of thousands of nicaraguan children who have been  displaced, wounded, orphaned or otherwise traumatized by the contra war, the  u.s. congress appropriated 17.7 million. two days after president reagan  signed the bill on oct. 1, president daniel ortega said nicaragua would not  accept the money.  to nicaraguans, refusing the aid was a symbol of dignity and national pride.  tied to the legislation was a second bill that provided a similar amount in  non-lethal aid to the contras, the very forces whose attacks on civilian  outposts were -- and still are -- responsible for the misery of many children.  for nicaragua to have accepted the aid, said paul oquist, an adviser to ortega,  would be comparable to the united states having accepted a donation of blood  from japan following the attack on pearl harbor.  \"if the u.s. wants to help children, lift the trade embargo and stop the war,\"  he said. \"that would stop the production of orphans and allow more (nicaraguan)  resources to deal with the problem ourselves.\"  critics of the sandinistas say the party\\'s bungling management of the economy  is the real reason for its desperate straights. they accuse the sandinistas of  torpedoing peace efforts with the contras, suppressing the opposition press,  squelching political dissent and endlessly confounding friend and foe alike  with contradictory actions.  nevertheless, representatives of u.s. and foreign relief agencies based here  and even mothers who have lost sons in the war say they supported ortega\\'s  action.  a summary of the immense effects of the war on children appears in a  little-publicized report prepared last summer by a team of american health  professionals sent to nicaragua on behalf of the u.s. agency for international  development to assess children\\'s needs. among their findings, gleaned from  interviews with 40 humanitarian agencies working here and with the nicaraguan  government:   -- about 500,000 of the nation\\'s 1.8 million children under age 17 have been  directly affected through destruction or disruption of schools and other  services, displacement from homes, death of parents, injuries and psychological  trauma.   -- at least 455 children under 15 years have been killed and 691 are missing  through the end of 1987. another 1,542 under 15 have been wounded, with an  additional 1,865 wounded among youngsters aged 15 through 20. about 1,200 have  experienced serious physical handicaps such as amputations and 568 children  have lost both parents, while 138 lost mothers and 9,371 lost fathers.   -- as many as 50,000 children have suffered psychological trauma after seeing  their villages shot up, parents or neighbors killed and having been forced to  resettle in strange areas.  despite the cease-fire treaty of last spring, attacks on farm cooperatives and  killing and wounding of children continue. in october, in the province of  jinotega, a well-marked red cross ambulance was shot up by contras and one  passenger was wounded. the contras also attacked a civilian truck, killing nine  civilians, three of them women. two children injured in the attack later died.  four civilians were killed in an attack in another province that occurred only  hours before hurricane joan struck on oct. 22.  two american physicians, tim takaro and susan cookson, who have worked for two  years in the jinotega war zone, said 300,000 of the u.s. aid had been slated  for treating intestinal parasites in 30,000 children in their region. but  conditions imposed by the u.s. agency for international development, which  administers such aid funding, would have undermined the existing health system  in nicaragua, they said.  aid requires that any private agency receiving federal funds have no connection  with the nicaraguan health ministry. yet takaro, cookson and other u.s. health  workers here agree that all private agencies working in health cooperate with  the government system because that is the most efficient and economical way to  get services to the people.  one of the health ministry\\'s goals since the 1979 revolution has been to expand  health centers in rural areas. the policy saved many lives during the contra  conflict. last summer\\'s report by the american team on the needs of children  noted with some surprise that the primary medical and social needs of most  war-injured and orphaned children had already been cared for within government  facilities. most who required specialized care not available in nicaragua were  sent to eastern bloc countries, it said. several health ministry doctors said  there has been great difficulty arranging for specialized care in the united  states.  the priority need now, the report said, is for continuing rehabilitation within  the children\\'s own homes.  all u.s. federal aid to nicaragua was suspended in 1981. some of the slack has  been taken up by u.s. allies, including canada, sweden, holland, italy, france,  spain and other european countries who have contributed hundreds of millions of  dollars in medical supplies and assistance. health ministry officials said the  severe strains on the economy have forced them to charge for certain health  services that were previously free.  health workers have also been victims of contra attacks. so far this year,  according to takaro and cookson, two volunteer nicaraguan health workers  (brigadistas) have been killed in jinotega province alone, eight have been  kidnaped and three are missing.  because brigadistas live in communities where there is usually no doctor or  nurse, their services are highly valued.  \"they are hard to replace when killed because others become too frightened to  volunteer,\" cookson said. \"eight health centers have been attacked by contras  in jinotega this year. some were destroyed and the medicine supplies were  always destroyed.\"  hurricane joan added to the general misery because of the destruction of crops,  homes, roads, bridges and service centers totaling 828 million, according to  the social welfare ministry. officials predict severe food shortages beginning  in the spring as a result of ruined bean and corn crops. the ministry has  called for 16.1 million in aid to clothe and feed for six months the 118,000  children whose lives were disrupted by the hurricane.

(anyone who asks why i don\\'t just go to the supermarket once a week and buy the  valuepak of brand x little chocolate doughnuts should stop reading. you\\'ve no  understanding of the american consumer and will miss the point of the story.)  one morning, overcome by the urge for little chocolate doughnuts, i walked into  the booze \\'n\\' munchies store for a dose of brand y\\'s lcds.  with a grimace, i bit into one. wham! light, fresh! oh-so-yummy! i looked at  the package: no \"new and improved!\" no \"now with even more chocolatey  goodness!\" but yes -- they were good! almost as good (dare i think it?) as  brand x!  i could purchase brand y little chocolate doughnuts proudly, no longer afraid  that others were looking upon me with scorn (\"mommy! he\\'s buying brand y!\"  \"don\\'t point, junior. some people aren\\'t as fortunate as we are. . . .\"). it  was a wonderful day!  a month later the booze \\'n\\' munchies store was sold. the new owner was behind  the counter one morning as i bought my pack of brand y little chocolate  doughnuts.  \"going to start getting brand x,\" he said.  \"great, although these have gotten a lot better.\"  he shrugged. \"well, now you\\'ll have your choice.\"  you\\'ll have your choice! boy, that\\'s the american way.  sure enough, a few days later, there they were, side-by-side: brand x and brand  y. what a great moment it was, being able to buy brand x little chocolate  doughnuts, the best little chocolate doughnuts. only. . . .  something strange hit me midway through my first pack of brand x little  chocolate doughnuts in months -- i missed brand y. had i grown accustomed to  brand y\\'s lower quality? was brand x too rich for my blood?  the next day i held a taste test, alternating a little chocolate doughnut from  brand x with one from brand y. after 12 little chocolate doughnuts, i arrived  at the startling conclusion: brand y had surpassed brand x in chocolatey  yumminess. i switched back to brand y. and i was happy. for about two weeks.  one morning i stumbled into the b \\'n\\' m store for breakfast. no brand y little  chocolate doughnuts. they weren\\'t just out -- the entire rack was gone. little  chocolate doughnuts, cupcakes, wholesome snack pies -- everything.  \"the brand y people refused to be in the same store with brand x,\" explained  the owner. \"said if i kept selling brand x, they\\'d pull out.\"  \"but i like their little chocolate doughnuts better than brand x\\'s,\" i  protested.  he shrugged. \"love to sell both, but brand x has the better name.\"  so i bought brand x. don\\'t get me wrong -- they were good. but they weren\\'t  brand y.  next morning, brand x was sold out.  \"distributor comes thursdays,\" said the owner. this was saturday.  after a little-chocolate-doughnutless weekend, i went into the store monday.  there, where once the brand y rack had stood, was a rack of brand z products --  cupcakes, wholesome snack pies and . . . little chocolate doughnuts. i bought a  pack.  eeyew!  brand z little chocolate doughnuts are not as bad as the old brand y little  chocolate doughnuts were, but brand z little chocolate doughnuts, as i\\'m sure  you experts will agree, simply have no taste. they\\'re only good for the  desperate times when brand x is sold out.  which is usually. the booze \\'n\\' munchies store gets its shipment of brand x  little chocolate doughnuts every thursday. by friday, they\\'re sold out.  \"i tell the guy every week to bring more,\" shrugs the owner. \"now, the brand z  guys, they always make sure we\\'re stocked.\"  using the booze \\'n\\' munchies store as our representative sample of the american  market, what have we learned?   -- brand x, the brand with the best reputation, ignores feedback and winds up  selling a fraction what it could.   -- brand y, the brand with the best product, refuses to compete in an open  market.   -- brand z, the worst of the three, is left to score the biggest sales.  now, as i sit here munching yet another brand z little chocolate doughnut, i  can\\'t help but wonder. in the huge conglomerate headquarters of brand z\\'s  parent company, just what language do you suppose they\\'re speaking?

       "  'text': 'the sight of rescue teams from around the world ignoring politics and rushing  help to victims of the earthquake in soviet armenia has been one of the bright  spots of a holiday season dimmed by disaster. we in the united states can take  pride in our contribution.  the instinctive response to the plight of the armenians sent forth a signal  that the people of the world realize that we live in a global village. leaders  of the soviet union abandoned their policy of secrecy and isolation while  long-time adversaries of the soviet union put aside past animosities.  the lesson of armenia is that politics is not an issue when human beings have  suffered terrible loss. a notable example came from an israeli rescue team,  some of whom had emigrated from the soviet union with no thought of returning.  although the two nations have not had diplomatic relations for more than 20  years, this did not hinder the mission in spitak and leninakan. the team stayed  for more than two weeks, triumphing when a 15-year-old boy was pulled alive  from the debris eight days after the earthquake.  unfortunately, there are children much closer to us geographically than those  in armenia who are homeless and hungry and whose parents have lost their lives  or livelihoods in a natural disaster. these children and their families have  not received aid through the government of the united states. they are the  victims of hurricane joan in nicaragua.  while the disaster in armenia was of much greater dimension, hurricane joan had  a devastating effect on nicaragua. it left 250,000 persons homeless. almost 3  million people lost crops or otherwise suffered economic loss. hospitals and  schools were damaged or destroyed. a team of united nations economists has  estimated the loss at 840 million.  despite appeals from members of congress and private groups such as oxfam and  the american friends service committee, the united states has refused  assistance to nicaragua. jamaica and costa rica, hit by the same storm,  received help from this country. there have been no explanations as to why  nicaragua was counted out. politics is the only apparent cause.  historically, u.s. policy has been to provide disaster relief as a purely  humanitarian gesture, independent of politics. this dates back to a successful  program led by herbert hoover to restore europe after world war i and has  continued through the marshall plan until today. in 1988 such aid went to  victims of floods in bangladesh and the sudan, monsoons in india and nepal,  typhoon ruby in the philippines.  these actions flow from the foreign assistance act, which authorizes the  president \"to furnish assistance to any foreign country, international  organization, or private voluntary organization, on such terms and conditions  as he may determine, for international disaster relief and rehabilitation.\" the  responsibility is clearly the president\\'s.  president reagan, in a recent interview with david brinkley, called nicaraguan  president daniel ortega a \"shameless dictator\" who \"doesn\\'t stand in the same  box with (soviet president mikhail s.) gorbachev.\" has the politics of aid  reached the point of distinguishing between avowed communists when giving or  withholding humanitarian aid? should we allow the behavior of the sandinistas  to keep us from responding to people stricken by disaster?  while we are not in open conflict with either the soviet union or nicaragua,  the recent history of national enmity makes it imperative to maintain the  principle of nonpolitical humanitarian aid to innocent civilians. to undermine  this principle erodes the internationally accepted geneva conventions that have  enabled the red cross, the red crescent and other agencies to bring medicine  and food to noncombatants in times of war.  the only country in the world that could pose a serious, immediate threat to  the united states is the soviet union. yet, we have responded generously to  innocent civilians in that country in their hour of need. under anastasio  somoza, whose regime was more brutal and repressive, the united states provided  relief to nicaraguan earthquake victims.  reporters have been told that the nicaraguan government would not accept  assistance if it were offered. the national assembly did reject a portion of  the contra aid package intended for all children who had been injured by the  civil strife. in mid-november ortega clarified that the ban was limited to the  contra package. shortly thereafter, the nicaraguan charge d\\'affaires in  washington said publicly that u. s. aid would be accepted through international  organizations.  the new openness of the soviet government, as it welcomes outside help and  becomes more a part of the world community, is a sign to the incoming  administration to reverse a foreign policy that has too often put ideology  above basic human needs, above values that transcend government or party. it is  time to reaffirm the american tradition of generous response to need simply  because the need exists.  providing humanitarian aid promotes the national interests of the united  states. we must recognize, however, that such aid makes its greatest  contribution to our credibility and our reputation in the world when it is  delivered in a nonpolitical manner.

       "  'text': \"you don't need a ph.d in economics to understand the european community's  common agricultural policy. it sets artificially high farm prices that create  vast food surpluses. in november, for example, the world price for corn  averaged 97 a metric ton. meanwhile, the policy promised european farmers a  minimum price of 212, a 119% premium. naturally, european farmers produce as  much as they can. any surpluses are then dumped onto the world market with huge  subsidies.  it's clear who's hurt. first come europe's consumers and taxpayers. their food  costs are too high, and 60% to 80% of the european community's budget goes to  the policy. next come more efficient farmers -- in the united states,  australia, canada, argentina and other nations -- who lose export sales to the  europeans. considering all these victims, there ought to be strong pressure on  the european community to change the policy. think again. an intense u.s.  campaign against the policy has had almost no success.  it's a telling failure of economic diplomacy. increasingly, the united states  can advance its economic interests abroad only with the help of other nations.  we're no longer so powerful that we can control the outcome of global  negotiations. but we're clumsy at creating the international coalitions  necessary to prevail. the farm negotiations (under the general agreement on  tariffs and trade, or gatt) are a case in point. when the talks recently broke  down in montreal, the americans -- not the europeans -- were mainly blamed.  make no mistake: the talks are critical for u.s. agriculture. they may  represent the best chance for america to cut its own costly farm subsidies.  american harvests are steadily rising last summer's drought only interrupted a  long-term trend. without expanding exports, u.s. farmers face rising surpluses  and falling prices. the pressures for continued subsidies would be enormous.  other food exporters confront the same dilemma. finally, greater agricultural  exports would help some developing countries escape the debt crisis.  but somehow u.s. trade negotiators have turned a strong moral position into  political weakness. it's not that other food exporters like the agricultural  policy. they don't. most of the european community's minimum prices (like that  of corn) are set well above market levels. in november, the minimum price for a  metric ton of soybeans was 577, more than double the world price of 267.  consumers pay these high prices. the community maintains them by buying any  surpluses at the minimums. cheaper imports are generally kept out with variable  levies that raise import prices slightly above the minimums.  the result is that farmers elsewhere lose exports to europe and must compete  with european food surpluses -- sold at subsidized prices -- in third  countries. the policy's protection has kept high-cost farmers in business.  efficient farmers are spurred to increase output by overusing fertilizers and  pesticides. food production has soared. the european community once imported  wheat it became an exporter in the early 1970s. since 1980, output of oil  seeds (such as soybeans) has more than quadrupled.  by all logic, the australians, canadians and others ought to be loudly echoing  u.s. demands that the europeans alter the policy. but the united states has  alienated its natural allies by insisting that all countries commit themselves  -- in advance of detailed negotiations -- to the eventual elimination of most  farm subsidies. for the europeans, this would mean signing an immediate death  warrant for the policy. that's political suicide. it was this humiliating  demand that caused the breakdown at montreal. other governments regard the u.s.  position as wildly unreasonable.  it's also unnecessary. the issue is not (as the u.s. position implies) all or  nothing. suppose the policy's excessive prices are cut 60% to 80% over a  decade. that would be an immense achievement. but the talks are now stalemated  over a non-negotiable principle. the europeans have scored a public-relations  coup and don't have to say how they'd change the policy to reduce its adverse  consequences.  the agricultural policy is not, of course, the only example of farm folly. in  addition to direct subsidies, the united states maintains import quotas on  sugar and dairy products. japan and korea restrict rice imports. any trade  agreement would have to attack all these distortions. the political obstacles  are similar everywhere. farmers have grown dependent on protection, and  governments often depend on the votes of farmers. but opening up world  agriculture is not a utopian dream. it has a big constituency -- food exporters  and, less obviously, taxpayers and consumers.  the trouble is that the united states has yet to mobilize this constituency.  any hard negotiation is full of drama and deadlocks. the gatt talks are  scheduled to continue until 1990. they could yet succeed. but for that to  happen, the united states will have to pursue its goals more adeptly. that's  the real lesson here. being right is not enough if, in the process, everyone  else is offended by american self-righteousness.  \",\n",

       "  'text': 'as concerns about the american economy grow, the debate over defense spending  continues at a feverish pace. an entire spectrum of ideas has been placed  before the public, with critics or \"defense experts\" having their own agenda on  how to cut defense in an effort to reduce the nation\\'s budgetary deficit.  the discussions of cuts that indiscriminately have an impact on defense  capabilities and current military readiness are both disconcerting and  frustrating.  the last eight years have seen some unmistakable gains in our military  readiness and capability. u.s. naval forces (in fact, all u.s. military forces)  have never been stronger or more ready. america\\'s position in the world has  also never been so strong. our friends, who have never feared our leadership  and have only wanted to count on our strength, can do just that. and potential  adversaries now have to recalculate their ambitions because of our strength.  still, we see a move by various people who seem hellbent on throwing those  gains away.  eight years ago, our political leaders -- with the support of the american  public -- committed themselves to an investment. the investment was a large  one, but was necessary to recover from the neglect of the 1970s when the  military suffered from low states of readiness. some ships couldn\\'t sail  because of material problems and personnel shortages aircraft readiness was  low because of lack of spare parts and trained maintenance personnel morale  problems abounded.  this tremendous investment provided the nation with an extremely capable fleet  and a professional personnel force that has never been more dedicated, spirited  or well-trained. simply stated, never has the navy been more ready to respond  to a wide range of contingencies and threats.  the question is, does the nation have the resolve to preserve its investment or  is it willing to return to the dark days of just a few years ago? to allow the  latter to happen and fail to protect the investment would be the biggest case  of fraud, waste and abuse this country has ever seen. history has repeatedly  shown us the consequences of complacency.  the critics would like to make us believe that we can\\'t afford a strong  military. they argue that the defense buildup has caused the budget deficit.  today, however, defense spending is less than 6% of our gross national product.  during the years of the so-called reagan buildup, it was never more than 6.3%  -- and it has declined steadily in the last four years. but 20 years ago, that  figure was 9% -- and we had a balanced federal budget.  if one looks at a graph of defense and non-defense spending since 1969 (the  last year of a balanced budget), we see that the curve for defense is  relatively flat but that the curve for non-defense spending keeps turning  upward at an alarming rate. and the key point is that the curve almost exactly  matches the slope of our federal budget deficit.  it is frustrating for those in senior military positions -- those who are  directly responsible for providing for our nation\\'s security and who had to  deal firsthand with our diminished capability in the last decade -- to see the  apparent complacency, the almost perverted idealism, the unscrupulous  politicking and the inability to see reason and logic in the one element of our  great democracy in which the national interest should be above parochial  interest.  it is frustrating to deal with those who argue that because we have built  something that works, we can afford to neglect it for a while. it is  frustrating to argue with those who can\\'t stand success, who can\\'t seem to be  comfortable with strength and who would apparently prefer being lovable losers.  why are we turning our backs on defense? people listen to soviet president  mikhail s. gorbachev, probably the greatest pr man in this century, and they  think, in the immortal words of neville chamberlain, that we will have \"peace  for our time.\"  unfortunately, it\\'s not true or at least, not yet.  it has long been a military axiom that you must not get tangled up trying to  unravel your opponent\\'s intentions. instead, you must keep your eyes on  capabilities. to that end, many intelligent people seem to overlook the fact  that soviet military capabilities continue to grow while their intentions are  being slickly packaged to look like democracy in action.  certainly something is happening in the soviet union today. but what it is,  what it means and how long it will last are still uncertainties. the soviets  have not dismantled a single military system that they were not bound to do  under constraints of treaty. except in afghanistan, they have not withdrawn  from a single maritime or military position.  it\\'s still a very dangerous world and the threat still threatens. we can watch  and hope. but let\\'s keep our heads on straight.

       "  'text': 'now that 1988 is behind us, it\\'s a good time to acknowledge those who helped  make our travel experiences bearable, even enjoyable, last year. some awards --  not for anyone who has been naughty, but only for those who\\'ve been nice.  best first-class service: singapore airlines. again this airline wins for  class, as well as style. it even wins for food, some of which is cooked to  order on board. if you like your eggs poached, they\\'ll be poached.  best business-class service: british airways. the airline has come a long way  from the old business class of coach seats and a few free drinks. its new club  class is well recommended.  honorable mention to virgin atlantic. the airline\\'s \"upper-class\" service is a  well-kept secret. it\\'s excellent, and equals, if not surpasses, other airlines\\'  first-class sections in terms of passenger space and other goodies, like a free  one-way coach ticket for taking just one trip.  best coach service: lufthansa. efficient, courteous and even the meals are  thoughtful, with things like fresh fruit.  best first-class seats: if you want to know the reason why royal jordanian  airlines has spent upwards of 10,000 per first-class airline seat, just sit  down. these hydraulic electric marvels are truly the closest things to real  beds an airline can provide.  rivals to first class  best business-class seats: a tie, between cathay pacific airlines and british  airways. both airlines radically restructured their business class in 1988, and  a major part of that included removing and redesigning business-class seats,  head rests, leg rests and added leg room. and both airlines did almost too good  a job in business class. each is now laboring to make its first class even  better, because in many cases the improved business class now rivals first  class on some other airlines.  best coach seats: no award. in this category, things have actually gotten  worse, not better.  cleanest planes: japan airlines. its flight attendants come as close to  providing perfect service as possible. can you name another airline where the  flight attendants rush into the lavatories after each passenger has left to  clean them?  best domestic airline: american airlines. it still has a deserved reputation  for consistency of service and one of the best route structures in the united  states. it is also an airline that is rapidly expanding to europe through new  u.s. gateways like raleigh-durham, n.c.  western winner  best regional airline: alaska airlines. the airline, based in seattle, offers  great in-flight food, good on-time performance, clean airplanes and some of the  nicest, most helpful flight attendants i\\'ve ever met. in case you haven\\'t flown  the airline, alaska flies to 32 cities in the united states and mexico.  best international airline: a three-way tie among singapore airlines, thai  international and sas.  best domestic airport: a three-way tie. if you define a great airport as (1)  convenient, (2) efficient and (3) passenger-friendly, then kudos must go to the  airports in oakland, kansas city and tampa. they are distinctly uncrowded, well  designed and pleasant.  best international airport: schiphol, in amsterdam. it defines the word  efficiency. and, if you like duty-free shopping, this is your place. honorable  mention: changi airport in singapore.  the humanitarian travel award: doubletree hotels. again this year, the hotel  chain will provide free short-term lodging for those in need during this  holiday season. the chain\\'s room at the inn program is offered to individuals  and families visiting loved ones in out-of-town hospitals, and runs each year  from thanksgiving through new year\\'s eve.  honorable mention to clark howard, a retired travel agency owner. earlier this  year, eastern airlines had a special promotion for its 60th birthday. the  offer: people who flew the airline 60 times in 60 days would get 60 free  tickets. eastern never thought anyone would take them up on the offer. but  howard did -- and won, then gave the tickets to several charities in georgia so  that local needy children could take their first plane ride as well as enjoy a  california vacation.  vacation tips  the safe travel award: westin maui. you can thank the hotel, or perhaps its  attorneys, for this, but thanks are due to the hotel for providing truly useful  information about the sun and surf. in a pamphlet distributed to its arriving  guests, the hotel gives specific tanning advice: \"spend a short time in the sun  during your first day or two and gradually build up during your stay.\" some  swimming advice: \"enter the ocean gradually and carefully. breakers come in  \\'sets\\' with spells of calm in between.\" plus: \"never turn your back to the  ocean.\" if this seems like basic common sense, it is. but remember, most  visitors to maui don\\'t live near the water, nor do they enjoy year-round  sunshine.  the thoughtful hotel award: a tie, between the hyatt key west hotel and  stouffer hotels and resorts. earlier this year, when the key west international  airport needed a face lift, but there was no county budget for the project, the  hyatt key west hotel staff donated their time and repainted the terminal.  stouffer wins for abandoning a long-standing rip-off in the hotel business. the  chain correctly identified a major traveler complaint, and dropped surcharges  on credit-card phone calls, collect calls and calls to toll-free 800 numbers.  three cheers to stouffer it\\'s about time. honorable mention to hyatt hotels,  which has decided against using the more expensive alternative operator service  (aos) to supply its long-distance service.  the thoughtful airline award: uta french airlines. in order to welcome  americans to france, folks who travel on a uta holidays trip will receive a  \"telecard\" good for a free four-minute call to the united states.  the freedom of travel award: to japan. an agreement was just reached between  the united states and japan exempting most americans from needing a visa to  visit the country. now, if we could only afford the visit!  and just for fun  there are also some unusual award winners:  the 1988 best travel lawsuit award: to the case of the sunburned buns. a court  in madison, wis., heard the story of the woman who stayed in the artificial sun  a little too long. the woman sued a local tanning salon, claiming she suffered  second-degree burns that ruined her vacation in jamaica by making it impossible  to bask on the beach. she won.  and, finally, the 1988 best retort to a lost travel lawsuit award: to robert  hazard, president and chief executive officer of quality international. the  company was sued by mcdonald\\'s after it announced its intention to use the name  \"mcsleep\" for a chain of budget hotels. after mcdonald\\'s won the suit, hazard  announced the new chain would be called \"jack in the sack.\" actually, the new  hotels will be called sleep inns.  merry christmas.

       "  'text': 'the names flopsy, mopsy and cottontail have never figured very large in my  adult vocabulary. not that they weren\\'t there. they were just too deep in  memory for easy retrieval.  your average semi-macho guys, or even us everyday garden variety couch  potatoes, just don\\'t tend to hang onto those memories we formed before being  checked out on two-wheel bikes. unless we\\'ve had a refresher course.  my wife and i recently had a refresher course.  a few months ago, we were in the lake district of cumbria -- which is about hip  high on the british isles -- and having a pretty good time. there aren\\'t a  whole lot of places on this earth as pretty or as peaceful.  many lakes  we were told there are 23 lakes. someone else said there are 19, so i suspect  the total number sort of depends on whether or not it rained recently. i do  know that however many there are, they\\'re in one of the most awe-inspiring  settings.  mile after mile of rolling meadows, forests and mountains, their tops  frequently lost in cloud. there are fields of wildflowers, waterfalls and about  every green that nature\\'s got.  there are sheep -- armies of sheep, eating as fast as they can but never  catching up with the growing landscape. and there\\'s something else . . . a  feeling that goes with the territory.  joyce and i were talking with paul carlin, a friend who\\'d come to the lake  district from london to manage the borrowdale gates hotel near keswick. he  grinned as we raved about the countryside, as proud as if he\\'d created it  himself.  visitors from all over  \"it\\'s truly unique, you know, and i know what you mean about the feeling,\"  carlin said. \"people come to the lake district from your wisconsin and  minnesota, where lakes are common.  \"even from colorado and british columbia, whose mountains and lakes dwarf what  we have here. and they\\'re just as enchanted as everyone else. and i think i  know the reason. it\\'s not the lakes, you know.\"  \"what is it?\" joyce asked.  \"well,\" carlin said, \"i\\'m almost afraid to talk about it.\" he leaned forward  and lowered his voice. \"it may be something left over from the druids or  merlin\\'s time, but i think it\\'s magic. i really believe there is a kind of  enchantment here.\"  we\\'d almost come to that conclusion on our own. you can\\'t drive through the  area without having that thought. we\\'d recently visited dove cottage, where  william wordsworth lived with his family.  though the cottage looks as if it\\'s 300 years old, it\\'s really kind of  commonplace. the most unusual thing about it is that the children\\'s rooms are  wallpapered with newspapers. (the guidebook said wordsworth thought it would  make the rooms warmer in the winter.)  setting is unusual  but it\\'s not the cottage, it\\'s the setting that makes it unusual. when you see  the view from the room where wordsworth did his writing, you begin to  understand.  you see lake grasmere cupped in rolling green hills, as still and reflecting as  a mirror. the morning we were there, a few clouds were all but settling on its  surface you could feel a bit of the magic.  there was no way a man of wordsworth\\'s talents could have lived in the area  without becoming what he was -- a poet laureate, the greatest poet on nature  that england has produced.  \"wordsworth? yes,\" carlin said. \" \\'lucy,\\' \\'the solitary reaper\\' and \\'daffodils\\'  are very nice. and you\\'ll never convince me that james hilton didn\\'t spend some  time here before he wrote about shangri-la in \\'lost horizon,\\' but i was  thinking more in terms of peter, flopsy, mopsy and cottontail.\"  \"who?\" i asked.  \"peter rabbit!\" joyce exclaimed. \"that\\'s right! beatrix potter lived here in  the lake country, didn\\'t she?\"  almost missed house  \"that\\'s what i meant by enchantment,\" carlin said. \"her house is just down the  way. i\\'ll jot down some directions for you.\"  it wasn\\'t \"just down the way\" at all. it was a couple of lakes and a few dozen  turns down a long road, but the trip wasn\\'t a chore, because the country itself  was satisfying.  we missed the house the first time and had to backtrack. we\\'d have missed it  again, except a small sign said, \"hill top house,\" which my wife recognized  from the stories.  at first there didn\\'t seem to be any true personality about the place. slowly  the lady herself, beatrix potter, began to take form as our guide walked us  through the garden.  \"it\\'s patterned after mr. mcgregor\\'s garden,\" she said. \"does that ring a  bell?\"  suddenly interested  it meant something to most of the visitors, including joyce, whose interest in  the garden was suddenly aroused.  \"who\\'s mcgregor?\" i asked. \"refresh my memory.\"  no one answered. they were all listening as the guide led us into the house.  she explained how miss potter had lived in an era that expected all proper  young women to go from their father\\'s house to their husband\\'s.  beatrix, a very average-looking young lady who spent a good part of her  growing-up years in the sparsely settled area, had been alone a lot. having few  callers and a great deal of time, she had taken to sketching and writing  stories about the things she knew and loved, like the countryside and some of  its inhabitants.  one of them was a very young rabbit, whom she named peter. it wasn\\'t much of a  story. it dealt with peter leaving his siblings -- flopsy, mopsy and  cottontail, who were \"good little bunnies\" -- and going out and losing the new  coat his mother had made him.  he lost it when he was almost caught by mr. mcgregor, whose garden peter had  been told never to visit.  limited edition  in 1902, probably more on the strength of the sketches than the stories, a  london publisher took a chance and brought out a limited edition of \"the tale  of peter rabbit.\"  there were no limitations from then on. beatrix potter wrote and illustrated  more than 25 children\\'s books, which were published in dozens of languages, to  the delight of millions of children. and then their children and their  children\\'s children.  \"did beatrix potter have children of her own?\" someone asked.  \"she eventually married a man named william heelis,\" the guide answered, \"but  she was childless.\"  a woman asked if miss potter had been able to enjoy any of her success, or  whether fame had only come after her death.  \"she was a very canny lady who enjoyed huge success and made a great deal of  money.\"  purchased land  the tour group grew silent.  \"in fact,\" said the guide, \"she loved the district so, that to have some  control over what might happen to it, she began slowly buying up more and more  property in the area to keep it from being destroyed by what the world calls  \\'progress.\\'  \"in addition to her writing, she spent her time working to protect all of this  part of cumbria, to keep it pure and unspoiled for all time. her efforts are  largely responsible for the fact that this whole district is now under the  protection of the national trust. god willing, and thanks to beatrix potter, it  may be protected forever.\"  the tour ended and we left the house, a few feet behind a young family. as we  entered the garden again, a bird flew out of the hedge just in front of us. the  daughter of the family, a girl of perhaps 4 or 5, heard the rustling noise and  turned quickly.  thought she saw him  \"oh, papa,\" she said excitedly. the mother and father stopped and turned. the  little girl spoke excitedly to her parents in a language neither joyce nor i  could understand. her father answered her and then smiled at us.  \"she wants to know was that peter rabbit who just came out of the bushes. i  told her i didn\\'t know because i had not seen.\"  the little girl thought for a few seconds and then, nodding her head firmly,  spoke again. her father translated.  \"she says she thinks it was peter rabbit, that she thinks she caught a glimpse  of him.\" the little girl ran around looking under rose bushes and behind hedges  for another glimpse as we approached the gate cottage.  interesting theory  almost as a conspirator, the father shared a final thought with his wife and  with us. \"it probably was not really peter rabbit, you know. that rabbit would  be 85 years old now.\" he winked. \"probably one of his children or his  grandchildren, huh?\"  carlin stopped by our dinner table in the hotel dining room that night and  asked if we\\'d made it to hill top house and what we thought of his theory.  \"you didn\\'t tell us what the lady had done for the district.\"  \"or,\" joyce said, \"that it was peter rabbit that really started it all.\"  \"and, i\\'ll bet,\" carlin said, \"that they told you beatrix potter never had any  children, too.\"  \"you mean she did?\" i asked.  \"the way i see it, she had millions of children . . . generations of millions  of children,\" he said. \"and didn\\'t she leave them a lovely garden to play in?\"  '},\n",

       "  'text': 'while millions watch as television personalities describe the visual wonders  passing before them in pasadena on monday, a pair of blind radio commentators  will offer their own view of the tournament of roses.  john and larry gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast live for  the third time from high in the press box.  the whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th birthday  monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on kpcc, pasadena  city college\\'s radio station, a program that will be carried all over the  country via satellite.  sighted listeners, too  experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on kpcc since 1980,  the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience.  after much preparation, including \"feeling tours\" of floats under construction,  they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other sightless  people. they often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and shapes  they have felt.  but larry shirk, program director of kpcc who also serves as the gassmans\\'  spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well.  \"we\\'ve had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on  television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the radio,\"  shirk said. he called the twins \"extremely intelligent, with marvelous senses  of humor.\\'  shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the broadcast  via satellite. kpcc is at 89.3 on fm radio and is the parade\\'s \"informational\"  station, shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information before and  after the parade broadcast.  as on the past two new year\\'s days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the  broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. monday. while others look down on orange grove  and colorado boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they rub  their freezing fingertips across pages of braille notes.  citing their biggest problem, john gassman said, \"when our fingertips freeze,  the braille becomes fuzzy. that\\'s like reading a printed page and the lights go  out. we tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but they  still froze. now we\\'re going to try a portable lamp with heat. actually, it\\'s  fun to figure out what to do.\"  transcribe into braille  in preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read aloud  and then transcribe the tapes into braille. then they tape their observations  while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and  textures. in combining all of the material, they said they are prepared for  every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background information  and details than they have ever needed.  in acting as spotter, shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to describe  anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official lineup.  \"he tells us to speed up or slow down,\" john said. \"anyone knows that when  you\\'re describing a float and a band goes by, there\\'s something wrong.\"  they said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast,  questioning and answering to \"keep it conversational.\"  \"we want to be talking to people, not at them,\" john said. \"talking at people  is an easy trap to fall into. we try to stay away from sounding like we\\'re  reading.  \"if we use humor, it\\'s not conscious, but if there\\'s something funny and its in  good taste, well. . . . \"  weekly program  they have had years of practice, anticipating each other\\'s comments and keeping  up a lively patter.  their weekly radio show, \"same time, same station,\" is on kpcc every sunday  from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their collection of  13,000 that include jack benny, bob hope, \"suspense\" and \"fibber mcgee and  molly.\" sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows.  their collection is what john called \"medium-sized, but all high-quality\"  recordings of the old programs. it began as a hobby and is continually growing  as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country.  they are identical twins who live together in their own home in whittier, where  they grew up and attended public schools. they are graduates of rio hondo  college, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as hosts  of a \"top 40s\" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s. they are  not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby, will lead  to jobs.  second nature  they said their parents, both of whom have died, \"purposely taught us that we  were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature.\"  they were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes of each  other, john weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and larry 1 pound, 10 ounces. as with  many premature babies born during the 1950s, they were permanently blinded by  excessive amounts of oxygen pumped into their incubators to help keep them  alive.  \"we\\'ve never been anything but blind, so we never thought about it,\" larry  said. \"we just learned to adapt and make the best of it. we\\'re not negative  people anyway.\"  they said they have had responses to their parade commentary from people all  over the country, not all of them blind.  \"no negative feedback, as far as we know,\" john said.

       "  'text': 'in what is developing into a territorial skirmish over mosquitoes, two  government agencies are swatting at each other over which of them would do a  better job of combating the city\\'s mosquito population.  the southeast mosquito abatement district, which oversees mosquito control in  the central and northeastern sections of the city, wants authority over  mosquitoes in the rest of long beach -- now the province of the city department  of health and human services. district officials contend the health department  is too busy fighting other public health threats, such as rats, to pay  sufficient heed to mosquitoes.  local health officials have, for their part, taken umbrage at the suggestion  that mosquitoes are running wild in their part of the city. they retort that  the abatement district is attempting to justify its mosquito grab with  error-strewn allegations that the city\\'s equipment, pesticides and vigilance  are inferior.  the district has long wanted to bring long beach under one anti-mosquito  umbrella -- its own. formed in 1952, the regional district assumed  responsibility for what was then unincorporated county land in the long beach  area. when the city annexed the land, the district retained mosquito  jurisdiction, leaving long beach divided as far as mosquitoes were concerned.  other communities served  what\\'s more, the city of signal hill, surrounded by long beach, is in the  district, as are the cities to the north of long beach.  \"we do a very extensive and thorough job of mosquito control,\" jack hazelrigg,  the district\\'s assistant manager and entomologist, said. while the city \"does a  good job,\" hazelrigg added, \"we can do a better job.\"  the district\\'s sole purpose in life is to keep mosquitoes in check, hazelrigg  stressed. it does that in 32 cities in los angeles county, along with  unincorporated parts of the county.  diana m. bonta, recently appointed director of the long beach department of  health and human services, says she has no vested interest in guarding the  city\\'s mosquito turf. nonetheless, she says she was disheartened at some of the  district\\'s contentions and feels compelled to correct them.  she also points out that it would cost residents slightly more if they switched  to the district, and she argues that a local, rather than a regional agency, is  more likely to be responsive to residents\\' complaints.  the arbiter of the matter, the city council, has referred the district\\'s  annexation request to its public safety committee, which is holding hearings on  the issue.  undecided on changes  \"personally, i haven\\'t found the city to be wanting,\" councilman ray grabinski,  the committee\\'s chairman, said. grabinski, whose west long beach district falls  under the city\\'s jurisdiction, hastened to add that he had not decided whether  any changes were in order.  the move to bring all of long beach into the district was bolstered last summer  when west long beach residents were tormented by swarms of midges, gnat-like,  flying insects that do not bite, but do bother people. \"you didn\\'t want to open  your mouth to breathe,\" said dan cangro of the wrigley assn., a neighborhood  group that complained to the council that the city\\'s bug-control efforts were  not all they might be.  \"it\\'s always been our contention that if we were under the mosquito (district)  program, we wouldn\\'t have these problems. . . . the city has been pretty good,  but it\\'s been on a case-by-case basis,\" he said, arguing that the health  department has neither the time nor the staff to devote as much attention to  mosquito control as does the district.  bonta, pointing out that midges are largely the responsibility of county flood  control authorities, says residents are mistaken if they think the district  will eliminate the midge nuisance.  the district is funded with annual property tax assessments of a couple of  dollars on every parcel within the district. it would therefore not cost the  city anything to relinquish its mosquito duties to the district.  but councilman evan anderson braude, also on the public safety committee,  argues that however small the fee, it will cost residents something. \"i\\'m not  particularly receptive to turning it over to the abatement district,\" said  braude, whose shoreline district is within the health department\\'s territory.  he, too, says he is satisfied with the department\\'s mosquito performance,  although he agrees that a case can be made for consolidating mosquito control  efforts in the city.  it costs the health department about 24,000 a year to run its mosquito  program, a sum that would likely be spent on some other city expense were it  not used on mosquitoes.  testifying before the public safety committee last month, bonta complained that  much of the district\\'s information about the city\\'s program \"is simply  incorrect.\" for instance, she said that contrary to the district\\'s assertions,  the department routinely sprays mosquito breeding areas and also uses  biological controls, such as mosquito fish, which consume mosquito larvae.  bonta further argues that since it is necessary for her department to monitor  mosquito-borne diseases, the city should continue to wage some of long beach\\'s  mosquito battles. it might even make sense to have the city take over the third  of long beach now treated by the district, she said, adding that the costs of  that move are being researched.

       "  'text': 'a city audit has concluded that police failed to respond to emergency calls  within the department goal of six minutes nearly half the time during a recent  7-month monitoring period.  a manpower shortage was cited as the reason in the audit by city administrators  and outside consultants.  the audit also concluded that the police department should eliminate two of its  four helicopters and consider transferring some of the officers from a special  neighborhood crime task force to other jobs.  according to the audit, officers did not meet the departmental goal of  responding within six minutes to crimes that are life-threatening or in  progress 48% of the time between july, 1987, and february, 1988.  the average delay was one second more than six minutes. response times ranged  from 3 minutes, 16 seconds to 16 minutes, 26 seconds.  during the monitoring period, the department had about 56 officers on patrol  and was about 10 below the staffing level approved by the city.  \"what i don\\'t understand is why can\\'t we fill those positions?\" asked city  director kathryn nack. \"we have the money, why don\\'t we have the people?\"  police chief james m. robenson said the department has had a difficult time  finding officers.  he said it is difficult to find qualified candidates since only about one in 75  is accepted. many potential applicants prefer to work on smaller suburban  forces, he said.  pasadena has tried to solve the problem by recruiting on college campuses  around the country and setting up a toll-free telephone number to provide  employment information, robenson said.  but robenson said the audit was wrong in assuming the shortage has affected the  department\\'s response time to emergency calls.  he said those calls are given top priority and even if a dozen new officers  were hired, it would not significantly lower response times. more patrol  officers, he said, would have a greater impact on less serious calls, which are  sometimes delayed while police respond to emergency calls.  robenson also said the audit was misleading because it did not count the  response time of police helicopters, which he said can reach the scene of any  crime in the city in less than a minute.  he added that even if the audit were accurate, a delay of a few seconds was  still well within an acceptable range.  \"sure i\\'d like to have the quickest response of any place, but we\\'re talking  about just a few seconds,\" he said. \"if the trend is between six and seven  minutes, i feel we\\'re delivering at least what we should.\"  police in pomona, which is comparable to pasadena in population, has an average  response time of 7 minutes, 50 seconds. pomona has 94 patrol officers.  the audit, which will be presented to the board of directors jan. 10, was part  of a series of reports commissioned by the city to study the operation of all  its major departments, such as water and power and public works.  the audit largely praised the police department for its responsiveness to the  community and innovative approach to law enforcement.  \"the pasadena police department can be classified as an organization on the  move,\" the audit stated. \"based on our analysis, the project team found no  major efficiency or effectiveness problems.\"  mayor william thomson said he was pleased with the results of the audit, saying  it confirmed his belief that \"we have a first-rate department.\"  but director william paparian said the audit\\'s conclusions led him to believe  the department has gotten away from the basics of law enforcement to pursue  \"sexier\" and more high-profile projects.  \"we ought to be going to more substance than flash,\" he said. \"we\\'ve gone off  on these sexy approaches and i think it\\'s time we get back to the basics.\"  one example, paparian said, was the neighborhood crime task force, a special  police unit formed to fight neighborhood crime and drug dealing, particularly  in northwest pasadena.  the audit praised the task force for its high number of arrests and  convictions, but noted the number of felony and drug arrests have dropped.  implications for task force  the audit team, which included city administrators and outside consultants,  said the smaller number of arrests for serious crimes may be the first sign the  3-year-old task force has outlived its usefulness.  the audit recommended the department consider transferring some of the task  force\\'s 18 officers to other jobs.  but robenson said cutting back the task force would be a \"disservice\" to the  northwest community, which still has the highest crime rate in the city.  while the number of felony and drug arrests did drop by about 20% during an  18-month period ending in 1987, the number of cases filed for prosecution  remained the same, the audit said.  robenson said the task force allows the department to focus on combatting crime  in the neighborhoods by freeing up officers for foot patrols throughout the  city and undercover drug enforcement.  helicopter unit  the audit also raised concerns about the efficiency of the department\\'s  helicopter unit, which auditors said has more helicopters than it needs.  the unit now has four helicopters, one of which is primarily used to ferry city  officials and demonstrate the capabilities of helicopters to police officers.  other cities of comparable size have two helicopters to accomplish the same  work, according to the audit.  \"i don\\'t know why we need to have our own air force with a budget of 1.1  million,\" paparian said. \"i\\'d like to see us spend that money on  bread-and-butter stuff like more neighborhood patrols.\"  the audit recommended selling two of the helicopters for an annual savings of  as much as 640,000.  but robenson said to achieve those savings the department would have to  eliminate daytime flights and cut back flight time from 3,750 hours a year to  1,170.  he said the department is spending about the same as other departments that  have just two helicopters. for example, he said, riverside police spent 1.3  million and newport police spent 900,000 last year to operate two helicopters.  robenson said having four helicopters is critical to the department\\'s patrol  strategy because they can reach the scene of a crime faster than a patrol car  and can cover much more territory.

       "  'text': 'after the dust from the whittier narrows earthquake on oct. 1, 1987, finally  settled, city officials began hearing from concerned business owners.  the earthquake knocked out telephone service, preventing the city\\'s 3,500  businesses from reporting emergencies such as fires and medical problems. the  nearly 80,000 workers who commute to santa fe springs daily clogged streets for  hours. at one point it took nearly 2 hours for a city fire truck to travel  about 3 miles from the fire station to city hall, said fire chief robert  wilson.  \"communications were terrible,\" wilson said. \"we were overwhelmed. we really  had no idea what was going on in the city.\"  the safety and satisfaction of the business community is especially important  in santa fe springs, where 85% of the land is zoned for commercial use.  \"in the daytime, we could have major problems just dealing with the numbers of  people\" who work here, said assistant city manager fred latham. \"and if this  were to occur at night, we could have unoccupied buildings with substantial  damage and not be aware of it.\"  partnership formed  as a result of these concerns, the public and private sectors in santa fe  springs have formed a partnership to design an emergency-preparedness plan that  would reduce the burden on city government in the three days after a disaster.  the santa fe springs chamber of commerce suggested that businesses establish  their own emergency communications network. city officials agreed, and in the  past year the chamber\\'s suggestion has evolved into an elaborate plan. though  supervised by the city, businesses will turn to one another instead of the city  when disaster strikes.  with just 15,000 residents concentrated in a 2-square-mile area, the best  option for santa fe springs is to rely on businesses in the other seven square  miles of town to provide their own emergency support, said tony ferrara, a  supervisor at the california specialized training institute. the institute is a  division of the state office of emergency services which is helping a committee  of city and chamber officials prepare the plan.  \"the city told the businesses, \\'we don\\'t have the traditional support systems.  so you are it,\\' \" ferrara said. \"this was a tremendous buy-in on the part of  industry . . . and the city was willing to depart from the norm as far as their  association with the private sector. what they are doing is making use of what  they have, and what they have is industry.\"  if an earthquake were to happen once the city\\'s plan is in place, this is how  businesses would respond:  command posts  they would immediately report to one of four command posts, where an area  coordinator would report any emergencies to city officials by radio. workers on  foot or riding bicycles would check neighboring businesses for injured  employees or other problems.  once damages are assessed, workers would turn to a handbook to see where  emergency supplies are available. under the cooperative plan, a food warehouse  might agree to donate food and another firm might provide blankets or plywood  for boarding up broken windows.  \"we are asking businesses to go beyond their own walls and hold hands,\" latham  said. \"it\\'s really exciting.\"  once post-disaster emergencies have been taken care of, the plan calls for  businesses to resume operations quickly. for example, a business using propane  might not be able to reach a supplier in los angeles, so the plan would include  a list of propane suppliers in the immediate area.  \"an important element is getting the businesses running again,\" wilson said.  \"they\\'re producing resources that can be used for the recovery effort.\"  disaster assistance  the plan also calls for familiarizing business owners with government disaster  assistance loans and grants.  rick landis, president of the santa fe springs chamber of commerce, said the  plan has met with an enthusiastic reception from the business community.  \"there are a lot of resources in this city, and most businesses are willing to  share them,\" landis said. \"we\\'re going to wind up with a business community  that is really well prepared. . . . we feel we are on the cutting edge of  emergency preparedness.\"  it will be about three years before the system is completely in place, latham  said. next month, the chamber plans to mail questionnaires to all santa fe  springs businesses, requesting their participation and outlining information  about operating hours, existing emergency plans and other relevant facts, he  said.  by the end of 1989, organizers plan to have the handbook distributed and  command posts set up. in 1990, they plan to complete training in disaster loan  procedures, first aid and other emergency measures. santa fe springs will  assign one fire department employee to supervise the effort, wilson said.  the city council, impressed by the efforts of the business community, has asked  city staff to develop a similar emergency response system for residential  areas, latham said.  ferrara hopes that santa fe springs\\' business network can become a model for  other cities and counties with large industrial bases.  \"the concept is that over a period of time, there will be a network of  communication and support,\" latham said, \"so when an emergency does occur, the  relationships will automatically be in place.\"  '},\n",

       "  'text': 'while millions watch as television personalities describe the visual wonders  passing before them in pasadena on monday, a pair of blind radio commentators  will offer their own view of the tournament of roses.  john and larry gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast live for  the third time from high in the press box.  the whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th birthday  monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on kpcc, pasadena  city college\\'s radio station, a program that will be carried all over the  country via satellite.  sighted listeners, too  experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on kpcc since 1980,  the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience.  after much preparation, including \"feeling tours\" of floats under construction,  they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other sightless  people. they often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and shapes  they have felt.  but larry shirk, program director of kpcc who also serves as the gassmans\\'  spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well.  \"we\\'ve had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on  television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the radio,\"  shirk said. he called the twins \"extremely intelligent, with marvelous senses  of humor.\\'  shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the broadcast  via satellite. kpcc is at 89.3 on fm radio and is the parade\\'s \"informational\"  station, shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information before and  after the parade broadcast.  as on the past two new year\\'s days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the  broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. monday. while others look down on orange grove  and colorado boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they rub  their freezing fingertips across pages of braille notes.  citing their biggest problem, john gassman said, \"when our fingertips freeze,  the braille becomes fuzzy. that\\'s like reading a printed page and the lights go  out. we tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but they  still froze. now we\\'re going to try a portable lamp with heat. actually, it\\'s  fun to figure out what to do.\"  in preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read aloud  and then transcribe the tapes into braille. then they tape their observations  while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and  textures. in combining all of the material, they said they are prepared for  every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background information  and details than they have ever needed.  acting as spotter  in acting as spotter, shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to describe  anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official lineup.  \"he tells us to speed up or slow down,\" john said. \"anyone knows that when  you\\'re describing a float and a band goes by, there\\'s something wrong.\"  they said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast,  questioning and answering to \"keep it conversational.\"  \"we want to be talking to people, not at them,\" john said. \"talking at people  is an easy trap to fall into. we try to stay away from sounding like we\\'re  reading.  \"if we use humor, it\\'s not conscious, but if there\\'s something funny and its in  good taste, well. . . . \"  they have had years of practice, anticipating each other\\'s comments and keeping  up a lively patter.  their weekly radio show, \"same time, same station,\" is on kpcc every sunday  from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their collection of  13,000 that include jack benny, bob hope, \"suspense\" and \"fibber mcgee and  molly.\" sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows.  their collection is what john called \"medium-sized, but all high-quality\"  recordings of the old programs. it began as a hobby and is continually growing  as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country.  they are identical twins who live together in their own home in whittier, where  they grew up and attended public schools. they are graduates of rio hondo  college, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as hosts  of a \"top 40s\" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s. they are  not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby, will lead  to jobs.  second nature  they said their parents, both of whom have died, \"purposely taught us that we  were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature.\"  they were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes of each  other, john weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and larry 1 pound, 10 ounces. as with  many premature babies born during the 1950s, they were permanently blinded by  excessive amounts of oxygen pumped into their incubators to help keep them  alive.  \"we\\'ve never been anything but blind, so we never thought about it,\" larry  said. \"we just learned to adapt and make the best of it. we\\'re not negative  people anyway.\"  they said they have had responses to their parade commentary from people all  over the country, not all of them blind.  \"no negative feedback, as far as we know,\" john said.

       "  'text': 'that low-slung, wooden couch with cushions covered in mexican serapes is not  cheesy: it\\'s monterey, jack.  what? you don\\'t remember the style of furniture that filled working-class los  angeles ranch houses in the 1930s and \\'40s, spread east with the lore of  westerns, then met an inglorious end in the rumpus room?  don\\'t blame don shorts and dolores fisher. the proprietors of a ventura  antiques shop, they take credit for rekindling interest in monterey furniture,  which is decorated with wrought-iron hinges, hand-painted donkeys, flowers and  sombrero-bedecked figures.  \"we like to be considered the pioneers in bringing this thing back to light,\"  explained shorts, 54, who co-owns the old california store on east thompson  boulevard with fisher, 55.  cowboy style  others may have received more publicity for selling the factory-made furniture  that ojai collector bob smith describes as \"a motion-picture version of what  cowboys might have had in the way of furniture -- if they had furniture.\"  but none of the handful of monterey dealers has done more to research and  promote a style whose history was little known 6 months ago, the couple\\'s  colleagues agree.  \"i would certainly give the most credit for the resurrection to don and dee,\"  said jack moore, a pasadena antiques dealer who for 7 years has traded in the  furniture that combines early california, mexican and western influences.  shorts and fisher have turned their 1926 home, which doubles as living quarters  and a showroom, into a monterey monument, with a rotating selection of dining  room sets, bedroom sets, living room groupings, mexican kitsch and at least  three photographs of will rogers.  they also publish a newsletter on the furniture, serve as hosts at \"openings\"  in the homes of clients, and organize outings to such shrines of monterey  furniture as rogers\\' 1921 ranch house in pacific palisades.  the couple even organized a museum exhibition last summer of the ersatz cowboy  furniture. \"monterey: an exhibition of california rancho furniture, pottery and  art\" filled one story and part of a second at the santa monica heritage museum.  an introduction  the exhibition enhanced the furniture\\'s status as a collectible by popularizing  it, antiques dealers say. it also introduced the style to kenneth trapp, a  curator of decorative arts at the oakland museum. now he plans to include it in  an upcoming exhibition of california craftsman furniture.  \"it struck me as wonderfully ludicrous,\" trapp said.  and so it is. consider the chaise lounge done up frontier-style, with a canvas  canopy to complete the covered-wagon look. or the grand piano fashioned out of  wood so rough-hewn that it looks as if it had been dragged through a mountain  pass.  in the last 2 years, the westward-ho look has become westward-haute. magazines  such as metropolitan home and better homes and gardens have praised monterey  furniture, tony los angeles shops have taken to selling it, and one shop even  peddles modern-day reproductions of it.  the limelight also has fallen on the designer of the monterey line, george  mason, an 81-year-old retiree now living in san luis obispo. instead of making  couches and chairs, these days mason occupies himself with painting, and lately  his favorite subject has been his own rediscovered furniture.  paintings exhibited  earlier in december, shorts and fisher mounted an exhibition of the folksy  paintings at their store. mason\\'s painted renditions of monterey furniture sold  briskly for as much as 185 apiece, while about 50 collectors competed for his  attention.  \"i came down from pismo beach just to shake his hand,\" gushed patricia slater,  53, a designer of what she described as \"cowboy punk\" furniture.  it almost seemed like the good old days to mason, whose father ran the los  angeles factory where his designs were made. in 1929, executives of barker  brothers furniture asked the pair to design and manufacture a line that would  bear the monterey name and would suit the ranch houses springing up all over  southern california.  the masons were told to take their cue from a settee that appeared in the  background of a warner brothers movie, \"old arizona.\"  made from oregon alder, stained in six colors and shaped into about 120 pieces,  each quirkier than the last one, the furniture was a hit, as were a host of  copycat lines: la fiesta, coronado, ranch-o.  monterey-style furniture spread to homes in texas, new york, chicago and  florida.  changing times  in 1943, mason was drafted his father died, and monterey came to a grinding  halt. after the war, tastes changed.  \"everyone threw it out and got chrome and glass,\" said betty gold, who stocked  her much-publicized melrose avenue furniture shop, territory, with monterey  purchased from shorts and fisher.  the distinctive furniture became, as one collector says, \"grist for garage  sales.\"  enter shorts, who 10 years ago quit his job as a high school history teacher in  santa barbara to devote himself full-time to his hobby of collecting old  paintings and furnishings.  the homemade crafts and pottery that sold at roadside stands throughout  southern california in the 1930s had begun to attract his attention. typically  decorated with sombrero-topped men either asleep beneath cactuses or leading  stubborn mules, they reminded him of his south gate childhood.  \"i was a \\'30s southern california child and have never outgrown it,\" he said.  shorts discovered monterey furniture and liked how well it matched the  knickknacks he was acquiring.  he bought the furniture first for himself, because he did not think it would  sell. in fact, it was not until 2 years ago that the shop began to deal  exclusively in monterey-style furniture and its trappings. since then, sales  have tripled, he said, and he delves into a network of thrift shops and  secondhand stores to replenish his stock.  despite all this, shorts was not sure until recently what he was selling. he  had noticed that the pieces were all branded with the same label -- \"monterey\"  -- but unraveling their origins proved difficult.  one person told him that the furniture came from monterrey, mexico. no, another  said, monterey, calif. but a monterey, calif., antiques dealer put that notion  to rest. \"oh, that\\'s what we call carmel furniture,\" she told him.  it was not until a friend found an old barker brothers catalogue that shorts  had a tangible lead. lacking details, however, shorts wrongly concluded that  the company had manufactured the furniture, not merely sold it.  error noted  mason, the furniture\\'s real manufacturer, noted the error when he read an  article about the santa monica exhibition. \"it made me so angry,\" remembers  mason, who complained to the museum\\'s director, tobi smith. she was only too  happy to hear from him.  smith enlisted both mason and shorts to write chapters in an upcoming catalogue  of the exhibition, which will include an essay by smith\\'s husband, bob, the  ojai collector, who also teaches furniture design at cal state northridge.  titled \"my mexicana nirvana,\" bob smith\\'s piece hails the furniture as \"a  unique manifestation of western urban culture.\"  \"woven with mythology, fantasy, eclecticism and pretension, monterey furniture  is synonymous with southern californians\\' collective search for a meaningful  identity -- a population with no heritage and little in common,\" he wrote.  bob smith believes that modern furniture buyers are attracted to monterey  because it tickles the modern fancy.  \"as an unabashedly eclectic and nostalgic movement, postmodernism says it\\'s all  right to borrow style or fake material if you are honest about it,\" he said.  and \"monterey furniture is honestly fake.\"  even honestly fake furniture comes with a price. a dining room set sells for  3,500 at the california shop, which is still less expensive than a fine chair  from the arts and crafts movement but is much more than the 79 mason remembers  the same pieces selling for originally.  but for collectors, such as alan erenberg, 39, the cost is worth it. he says  the furniture perfectly fits the hacienda-inspired architecture so prevalent in  southern california. a vice president of serta, the mattress company, he and  his former wife, lori, replaced their collection of \\'50s furnishings with  monterey when they bought a 1920s california ranch house. when they recently  divorced, he said he \"got custody\" of the furniture, which now decorates his  spanish revival apartment in venice.  that does not mean, however, that everybody loves monterey.  some of gloria list\\'s clients at nonesuch gallery in santa monica \"find it  garish and klutzy,\" she said. and even converts can tire of monterey\\'s quirky  style. two of shorts\\' best customers, he sadly reports, recently tossed out  their monterey collection in favor of crisp, contemporary furnishings.  but mason is glad that at least some see the world through his eyes. after  returning from military service, he longed for the monterey days. first he  represented another furniture company then he ran a store that sold colonial  furniture.  \"i was an unhappy guy,\" he said.

       "  'text': 'the state has dropped its threat to fine the city up to 30,000 in connection  with a june mishap at a household toxic-waste roundup after city officials  warned that they would refuse to hold more roundups.  the state department of health services cited whittier for failing to report to  the state that a contractor hired to manage the roundup created a small toxic  cloud by mixing several types of acids together. by law, the state should have  been notified within 60 days.  jim marxen, a spokesman for the department of health services, said the state  decided against the fine because it might scare off other cities conducting  toxic-waste roundups. in such roundups residents dispose of household chemicals  such as paint thinners and insecticides. about 400 households participated in  whittier\\'s roundup.  \"we\\'re not after the money,\" marxen said. \"what we\\'re after is having them  comply with the law and understand that they have violated the law. . . . the  public airing of their fault was felt to be enough of a punishment.\"  city\\'s position  michael woods, an attorney who handled the case for whittier, said the city was  \"not simply going to roll over\" and take the fine. the city\\'s position has been  that any fine as a result of the accident should be paid by the contractor,  omega recovery services, which was paid 60,000 for the job, woods said.  city officials also told the state that if whittier were fined, the city would  refuse to conduct any more toxic roundups, he said.  \"if the city was going to end up getting slapped with a fine for its  responsible effort (to hold the roundup), then why take that risk?\" woods  asked.  in an out-of-court settlement of the issue, city officials agreed to:  make presentations to other cities in the los angeles area about the correct  way to run a household toxic-waste roundup  provide extra training over the next eight months to city employees involved in  handling hazardous wastes.  send the state within 60 days a detailed plan for any future hazardous-waste  roundups.  request state approval at least 60 days before any future roundup. the state  normally requires only 30-days\\' notice from agencies who want to organize such  events.  \\'going to be watching\\'  \"this is just as serious as when we were talking about the fine,\" marxen, the  health services spokesman, said of the agreement. \"we\\'re going to be watching  (whittier officials) pretty closely in the future because of their track  record.\"  during the roundup, dennis o\\'meara of omega recovery services mixed several  types of potent nitric acid in a 55-gallon drum. o\\'meara, who was not wearing  the proper protective clothing, was treated at a hospital after his face and  arms were burned.  after the citation was reported in news accounts, the city fired tom bayles,  the assistant public services director responsible for hazardous waste  disposal.

       "  'text': 'bewildered friends and followers would recall that he looked tired and  depressed, still grief-stricken and mystified over the savage assault on his  wife.  little more than a week had passed since he found her comatose on the garage  floor, choked senseless and left for dead. she had not regained consciousness.  now, in the early evening hours of april 30, 1987, the intense, balding man  excused himself and disappeared into a private hospital suite.  he locked and chained the door, sat down with pen and paper and began composing  a chilling letter.  \"there is a demon inside my soul,\" he wrote. \"it has always been there. my  demon tries to lead me down paths i do not want to follow. at times that demon  has lured me into doing things i do not want to do.  \". . . my demon has finally gotten the upper hand.\"  when security officers broke in the next morning, they found him sprawled  across the bed. he was alive but unconscious and in critical condition.  nearby were empty bottles of prescription drugs and his rambling letter, which  began with instructions for his funeral and ended thusly:  \"i have finally made the decision to take care of myself. i have grown weak.  god has remained strong. therein lies your hope. i have none.  \"walker l. railey.\"  the vicious attack on walker railey\\'s wife and his ensuing suicide attempt  devastated three families, split a church and outraged a city.  for peggy railey was by no means an ordinary homemaker, and her husband was  perhaps dallas\\' most dynamic and socially conscious young minister. at 39,  walker railey reigned as the senior pastor of the city\\'s 6,000-member first  united methodist church and loomed as a rising star in his mainstream  protestant denomination.  the news of the suicide attempt swept through town, nowhere more devastatingly  than at first methodist, where railey\\'s flock was already reeling from the  attempted murder.  \\'keep him in our prayers\\'  his chief assistant, the rev. gordon casad, told the congregation the next  sunday, \"we must remember our pastor and the troubling of his mind and spirit  and keep him in our prayers.\"  asked if railey was now a suspect, park stearns, supervisor in the dallas fbi  office, replied: \"this is a big no comment.\"  although police refused to reveal the contents of railey\\'s letter, they  described it as an apparent suicide note. and they redoubled their efforts to  review with the convalescing minister what happened the night his wife was  attacked.  a fellow pastor, the rev. david shawyer of plymouth park methodist church,  said, \"i\\'m praying that it is not what it looks like. i\\'m praying that what the  police are suggesting could never be true.  \"i\\'m praying this will all come out some other way.\"  latest twist in mystery  railey\\'s attempt on his own life was only the latest twist in what would be  called dallas\\' most haunting and sensational mystery in a decade. one  unrestrained commentator called the attempted murder the city\\'s most  extraordinary crime since the assassination of president kennedy.  peggy railey survived, but only barely so. comatose, she could not identify her  assailant.  several anonymous, typewritten death threats preceded the attack, apparently  provoked by railey\\'s strong sermons and public statements against racial  prejudice and injustice. but friends said peggy railey did not frighten easily,  and she had encouraged her husband not to soften his stand.  the last letter was slipped under the door of a church office just prior to  easter sunday services. it said: \"easter is when christ arose, but you are  going down.\"  wore bulletproof vest  under the stern scrutiny of security officers, railey delivered his easter  sermon wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his robes.  it would be his last appearance in the pulpit of first methodist\\'s historic old  sanctuary. he hammered the congregation with a theme of death and resurrection  that morning.  \"you\\'re going to die,\" he said, pointing his finger at parishioners.  \"you\\'re going to die,\" he repeated.  \"i\\'m going to die.\"  police and church officials first theorized that the attempt on peggy railey\\'s  life was some kind of grotesque retaliation for her husband\\'s outspokenness.  with his wife in critical condition, railey stationed himself outside her  hospital room, interrupting his vigil only for a trip downtown to give  investigators an account of his activities the night of april 21.  noticed open garage door  he said he\\'d spent the evening doing research at southern methodist university  libraries. returning home about 12:40 a.m., he said, he noticed that a door to  the darkened two-car garage was partly open.  driving inside with his headlights on, he found his wife lying on the floor,  writhing in convulsions. her face was puffy and discolored and she was frothing  at the mouth.  he said the children, ryan, 5, and megan, 2, were inside the house and  unharmed.  after the interview, capt. john holt, 37, the tall, sandy-haired supervisor of  crimes against persons, told reporters the questioning was routine.  \"we don\\'t have any indicators that would point to him as a suspect,\" he said.  arranged for hospital suite  railey returned to the hospital to arrange for a suite near his wife. he spent  the day greeting a parade of visitors who expressed shock, sorrow and support.  among those who came to share their grief that day was a striking frosted  blonde who carried a single red rose and disappeared into railey\\'s hospital  suite.  with the investigation in full swing and the fbi trying to identify the source  of the death threats, railey continued his hospital vigil under heavy police  protection.  \"he\\'s just numb. . . . he\\'s overwhelmed by it,\" said ralph shannon, a longtime  church member.  if railey was silent, his ministerial colleagues were not.  rabbi joseph ofseyer of congregation shearith israel said that railey had  suffered for his message of justice and equality but that the religious  community would not \"be cowed into silence\" and \"permit such a person to stand  alone.\"  almost lost or overlooked in the outcry was an observation by police lt. ron  waldrop that the abusive letters appeared to be the work of one individual and  not the concerted effort of a white supremacist group.  \"there\\'s no central theme,\" he added.  a short time later, the fbi determined that the death threats had been written  on an office typewriter at first methodist.  walker railey\\'s rise to clerical prominence seemed almost preordained from his  turbulent childhood days in owensboro, ky., a coal mining town on the south  bank of the ohio river.  the oldest of three children, railey grew up a nonsmoker and nondrinker who  delivered his first sermon at age 17 and became something of a circuit preacher  while a history major at western kentucky university.  he attended vanderbilt divinity school for a year, then headed to dallas and  the perkins theological seminary at southern methodist university.  it was there, in 1970, that he met margaret nicolai, an equally talented,  intelligent and religiously dedicated young musician whom everyone called  peggy. she had arrived at smu from wisconsin to pursue a master\\'s degree in  organ music.  acquaintances say peggy recognized early on that young walker was a man with  great ambition and potential but that she was not much taken with him  romantically. his persistence won her over and the couple were married in  august, 1971.  after obtaining a doctor of ministry in 1973, railey ministered to several  rural churches in oklahoma and then was appointed an associate pastor at first  methodist in dallas. in 1980, after a stint as a senior minister at a suburban  dallas church, he returned to first methodist as senior pastor at age 33.  eight ministers became bishops  the appointment was the most dramatic step in a meteoric rise. although not  even the largest methodist church in dallas, first methodist had the reputation  as the nation\\'s mother church of methodism, in no small part because eight of  its ministers had gone on to become bishops.  under railey\\'s leadership, first methodist grew and prospered, its membership  approaching 6,000 and its annual budget doubling to 2 million. and although  railey himself was short, balding and physically unimposing, his radiant  ministry served as a magnet for the young, energetic and socially conscious  while not alienating older, more conservative parishioners.  he spoke out boldly against those who practiced or condoned racial intolerance.  he clashed with a city council member over what he perceived to be a racist  stance on illegal aliens.  he challenged president reagan to take a \"more visible and articulate stand\"  for peace and he once said of fundamentalist jerry falwell, \"i guarantee he  doesn\\'t speak for the kingdom of god, let alone the people in it.\"  when the threats came, the raileys seemed to take them in stride. the fbi  encouraged peggy railey and the children to leave town for a while. although  she went to her parents\\' home for four days, she did not seem overly concerned.  diane yarrington, wife of first methodist\\'s minister of music and one of peggy  railey\\'s closest friends, said peggy told her that she and walker were taking  precautions but that they refused to be intimidated.  long before the attack, the yarringtons and raileys pledged to care for one  another\\'s children in the event of tragedy.  that pledge would soon come due.  as railey and his wife lay near death in the same intensive care unit, police  were anxious to talk again with first methodist\\'s senior pastor. after his  first interview, police found unspecified \"inconsistencies\" in railey\\'s account  of april 21.  friends in the church hired a tough, no-nonsense criminal defense attorney  named doug mulder to advise railey, and as the minister recovered, he wasn\\'t  talking to police.  he did, however, speak with reporters.  \"to be honest with you . . . i just don\\'t know anything,\" he told a veteran  religion reporter.  later, he told the associated press:  \"i didn\\'t attack my wife. i didn\\'t plan to have someone attack my wife. i  didn\\'t orchestrate a plan to attack my wife. and if i had written the letters,  i wouldn\\'t have written them on a typewriter in the church. but i didn\\'t write  them.\"  \\'i don\\'t understand why\\'  he could not rationalize his suicide attempt, which he knew was construed by  some as an admission of guilt.  \"i don\\'t understand why i did it, any more than i understand why i lived beyond  it.\"  mulder arranged for a private polygraph test, which indicated that railey did  not try to kill his wife. presumably because of those results, mulder approved  a police-administered examination the next day. that exercise was described as  \"inconclusive.\"  \"the results showed that he didn\\'t have anything to do with the attack, nor did  he conspire with anyone,\" mulder said.  though railey\\'s followers took new heart, investigators were unimpressed and  restated the ongoing request to interview him.  holt accused mulder of misrepresenting the outcome of the police-administered  examination. he suggested that some of railey\\'s responses were \"untruthful,\"  but refused to elaborate.  all but overlooked in the flap over the polygraphs was an unattributed police  statement that railey\\'s account of his activities the night of april 21 was \"in  direct conflict with indisputable evidence.\"  the key word was \"indisputable.\"  the frosted blonde with the sparkling eyes was no stranger to the congregation  at first united methodist church. lucy papillon grew up in the magnificent  sanctuary, the daughter of the rev. robert e. goodrich jr., a former senior  pastor and later a methodist bishop.  a portrait of goodrich, who died in 1985, hangs in the first methodist foyer.  \"she had that knotted goodrich chin, his thin, drawn smile, and the dark eyes  that were his most distinctive feature -- eyes that seemed remote but also  searching and intelligent,\" journalist larry wright, a childhood acquaintance,  wrote in texas monthly.  \"it was a strong face, like her father\\'s, and if in some lights it appeared  hard, in others you could detect a vulnerable and even wounded soul who had  lived past the point where life surprised her.\"  as a youngster, lucy played the piano in sunday school and was a cheerleader at  an exclusive girls\\' school. she entered southern methodist university in 1959  to pursue a degree in music education and, four years later, married a  methodist preacher. they were divorced in 1973 after she bore two sons.  worked variety of jobs  friends say she worked at a variety of jobs, including a stint as a part-time  model. somewhere along the way she became enamored with psychology. she married  and divorced again and, in 1982, received a doctorate in psychology and moved  to california to complete her training. she found various jobs in her new field  there and reportedly began to visit the esalen commune.  and it was there that lucy decided to take on her identity as \"papillon,\"  french for butterfly. in 1986 she opened a private psychology practice in  dallas and legally changed her name to lucy papillon.  on july 14, 1987, dallas county\\'s chief prosecutor sat down with police and the  fbi and heard for the first time all the facts of the case.  challenged to \\'talk or walk\\'  his face flushed with anger, his thick mustache almost bristling, norm kinne,  53, stormed from the meeting room into a cluster of reporters and challenged  walker railey, as one headline proclaimed, to \"talk or walk.\"  eyes flashing and his finger jabbing at the nearest of four television cameras,  kinne declared:  \"i\\'m tired of this man fooling with the justice system and the life of his  wife. . . . i\\'m going to tell you, walker railey, i\\'m tired of you messing with  the dallas police department, and you\\'re going to come before the dallas county  grand jury and you\\'re going to clear up these discrepancies, or you\\'re going to  leave the country!\"  kinne could subpoena railey to appear before grand jurors, but he had no way to  compel him to answer questions if he invoked the constitutional protection  against self-incrimination. nor was it in the fiery prosecutor\\'s domain to  order a reticent railey out of the country.  photographs triggered outburst  but at that moment, nobody was foolhardy enough to argue the issue with kinne.  later that evening, a vaguely contrite kinne said it was the photographs of  peggy railey after the attack that so outraged him and triggered the outburst.  \"i got irritated because we have a lady here who is a loving wife and mother  and who is lying in a hospital more dead than alive,\" he said. \"and we have an  alleged pillar of the community who will not talk to us about this.\"  six days before kinne\\'s outburst, a dallas morning news story linked lucy  papillon to the railey case, calling her a potential \"reluctant witness.\"  the article said mobile telephone records revealed that railey called papillon  twice the night of the attack. railey had neglected to mention those calls in  his lengthy interview with police the morning after april 21.  two calls placed to home  phone records also showed that railey placed two calls to his own home between  midnight and 12:30 a.m., the last one about 10 minutes before he reported  finding his wife near death on the garage floor.  investigators refused to discuss the significance of the mobile phone records  but it seemed safe to assume they somehow represented the \"indisputable  evidence\" of inconsistencies in railey\\'s story.  later, on the eve of a grand jury meeting on the railey case, the morning news  reported that railey had visited papillon the night his wife was attacked.  inside the jury room, kinne was eager to confront railey, although he was  certain that the embattled minister would refuse to answer questions and invoke  his fifth amendment rights. railey took the fifth -- 43 times.  knew nothing about attack  \"i have followed the advice of my lawyer consistently and will consistently do  that,\" railey remarked brusquely when he emerged from the closed-door session.  papillon spent an hour before the panel and, according to her attorney, phil  burleson, answered every question. she knew nothing about the attack, burleson  said, and then cautioned reporters against drawing conclusions that his client  was romantically linked with railey.  but it made no difference. leaks poured out of the grand jury room that lucy  papillon was walker railey\\'s mistress.  according to those present, papillon told grand jurors she first met railey on  a religious television show and they became romantically involved in june,  1986, about the same time she changed her name. she said she had accompanied  railey on several ministerial trips and had vacationed with him in california.  nor were their liaisons confined to this country. papillon revealed that railey  stopped over for a prearranged rendezvous in london while returning from a  world methodist council meeting in nairobi, kenya, in july, 1986.  in one particularly chilling disclosure, lucy said they embraced and kissed in  walker\\'s hospital suite while peggy lay near death nearby.  despite the sensational revelations, the grand jury testimony raised almost as  many questions as it answered. and the \"indisputable evidence\" remained cloaked  in secrecy.  \"we still have a lot of discrepancies, but we\\'re not going to discuss them,\"  said police lt. waldrop. \"there is no statue of limitations on attempted  murder, and that\\'s how long we\\'ll be working on it.\"  eventually, the discrepancies and the indisputable evidence did unfold.  on the night of the attack, railey made several calls from a cellular telephone  installed in his car at church expense only hours earlier as a security measure  because of anonymous threats. a phone company computer recorded the times.  railey called home at 5:55 p.m. to say he was leaving the office. at 5:58 p.m.,  he telephoned papillon and talked for one minute.  arriving home shortly before 6:30 p.m., railey said he found his wife working  on a faulty garage door lock with a bar of soap. investigators later found no  trace of soap on the lock, which was working fine.  railey said he sat on the hood of his wife\\'s chrysler and talked with her for  several minutes. he told her he intended to spend the evening on a research  project at the smu libraries. he did not change from his business suit and left  the house a little after 6:30.  at 6:38 p.m., railey, who never wore a watch, called on the car phone for the  time.  he said he spent half an hour or so at smu\\'s bridwell library and was back in  his car by 7:26 p.m., at which time he phoned the family baby-sitter and  discussed plans for a trip to san antonio the raileys planned later in the  week.  at 7:32 p.m., he phoned papillon at her home near smu. he drove directly to her  house, where he spent the next 40 minutes.  railey went back to library  railey told a friend later he went there to get some relaxation tapes to help  relieve stress.  from 8 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., railey was back at bridwell, where he asked a  librarian what time the library closed. at 8:30, railey, using a pay phone,  called home on a private line. peggy railey told him she was putting the  children to bed. she then called her parents long distance in tyler and talked  from 8:49 p.m. until 9:14 p.m.  at 8:53 p.m., raily bought gas at a texaco station near campus. after drinking  a wine cooler, he said, he returned to fondren library, smu\\'s main library. but  no one saw him there until after 11 p.m.  at 9:30 p.m., a jogger in the raileys\\' neighborhood spotted a man in a business  suit and street shoes running through a yard south of the railey home. between  10:15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., a neighbor heard rustling sounds in the alley behind  the home.  tried to leave business card  sometime after 11 p.m., a librarian saw railey at fondren. upon leaving at  midnight, he attempted to give his business card to a student at the checkout  desk. on the back of the card was a message requesting help in finding research  information. railey also noted the time, 10:30 p.m., when in fact it was  midnight, the student told police.  at 12:03 a.m., railey called home on the car phone, but this time he used the  public line. according to friends, the family seldom answered the public line,  which was connected to an answering machine.  \"hi, babe,\" he said. \"i\\'m calling you from my mobile phone. peg, it\\'s about,  oh, i don\\'t know. i don\\'t have a watch. it\\'s somewhere between 10:30 and 10:45,  somewhere along in there. i worked at bridwell until they closed and now i\\'m  going to fondren.\"  this could not have been true. he had in fact just left fondren, according to  other accounts.  \\'lock the garage door\\'  \"i\\'ll be in about 1. if you want to, go ahead and lock the garage door and i\\'ll  park out front. it really doesn\\'t matter to me at this point. my concern is  that you\\'re safe. . . .\"  this portion of the tape might explain why peggy railey would enter the garage  that night. even so, railey would still have to explain why, if he really  intended to speak with his wife, he had called on the public line and left a  message.  twenty-three minutes later, railey phoned the answering machine again, and on  this occasion gave the correct time: 12:29.  \"hi, babe,\" he began. \"it\\'s 12:29 and i\\'m on the way home from smu. . . .  everything really went well. i got a lot accomplished. i had to leave my card  with the reference librarian because there was one deal that i couldn\\'t quite  work out. i\\'m not calling on the private line because i know you\\'re already  asleep, but in case you get up with the kids, i just wanted you to know that  i\\'m on my way home. it\\'s 12:30. i\\'ll be home about 12:45.  \"love you. bye-bye.\"  no sign of a struggle  at just past 12:40, railey drove into his driveway and found his wife.  there was no sign of a struggle. there was no skin under her fingernails to  indicate that she had either fought her assailant or scratched herself when  grasping at whatever was pulled around her throat.  railey said he determined that the children were safe and notified police.  \"dallas emergency, ms. . . ,\" the dispatcher answered.  \"this is walker railey,\" he interrupted. \"send the paramedics and police,  please.\"  an ambulance arrived, along with neighbors. inside the house, both children  were in the living room, megan watching a silent television screen and ryan  staring blankly ahead.  months later, kinne told a reporter he thought it possible that ryan witnessed  the attack, but he said the youngster gave investigators inconsistent accounts  of what might have happened that night.  \"maybe daddy did it,\" the boy told investigators once.  doctors transferred peggy railey, her body alive but her brain barely  functioning, from a dallas hospital to a nursing home in east texas so she  could be near her parents.  bill and billie jo nicolai live in tyler, but they had spent almost all day  every day in dallas, about 60 miles away, attending to peggy\\'s needs. though a  full-service hospital was no longer required, she remained in a vegetative  state from which she might never awaken.  back in dallas, no sign was posted, but the raileys\\' home was quietly put on  the market and sold.  walker railey voluntarily surrendered his credentials as a minister in the  united methodist church, and then surrendered control of his wife\\'s legal  affairs to her parents. he granted temporary custody of his children to the  friends who had kept them since april 22, john and diane yarrington.  mother assumed guardianship  billie jo nicolai requested that a court grant her guardianship of her  daughter, and railey waived his right to continue in that traditionally spousal  role.  and then, after the stunning developments and disclosures of mid-november,  railey vanished.  \"i know he has some job prospects,\" yarrington said.  over the next few months, railey and dallas reporters played a game of  hide-and-seek.  in early december, railey told religion reporter helen parmley of the dallas  morning news in a telephone interview from california that he fled despair, not  speculation. and he maintained that he was not abandoning his children.  \"in this case, while i am relocating, looking for work, financially strapped,  not knowing where i\\'m going to end up or what i\\'m going to be doing, everybody  involved in this drama believes . . . the most stable, loving, christian  environment they can be in is where they are,\" he said.  but before anybody could get themselves too lathered up over railey\\'s plight,  dallas times herald columnist laura miller put a new slant on the case by  telling a tale of the anger and indignation of peggy railey\\'s family -- her  father and her grandmother.  both believe railey was behind the attack.  the motive? \"a divorced man doesn\\'t get to be bishop,\" said the grandmother,  ella renfro.  larry wright, a contributing editor at texas monthly magazine, grew up in the  first united methodist church in dallas. his childhood pastor was robert  goodrich jr., lucy papillon\\'s father.  he left the church once in disenchantment but had been drawn back by railey\\'s  socially contemporary ministry. then he had seen the devastation at first  methodist after the attack on peggy, walker\\'s suicide attempt and the  minister\\'s affair with lucy.  so wright was less a journalist than a confused and angry member of the  congregation when he confronted railey.  did peggy know about his affair with lucy?  \"we -- that never came up,\" railey stammered.  she didn\\'t know?  \"i can only say it never emerged.\"  did she suspect?  \"i have no way of knowing, regarding that, that she suspected at all, about  anything.\"  changing the subject, railey revealed he had slipped into the first methodist  sanctuary to attend funeral services for a family friend. some of his former  parishioners avoided him but most embraced him.  \\'they could feel pain\\'  \"they could feel my pain,\" railey said, crying. he said he also felt love.  did you feel a sense of shame, wright asked.  \"i felt a great need to be forgiven, if that\\'s what you\\'re talking about.\"  wright decided that was as much of a concession as he was likely to get. but  before departing, he said he could not construct an innocent man out of  railey\\'s behavior. the journalist recounted railey\\'s misleading testimony to  the police, his avoidance of the grand jury and his inexplicable actions on the  night of the attack.  \\'i think you are guilty\\'  \"i think you are a guilty person,\" wright said.  \"i hear what you\\'re saying,\" railey replied.  wright did not know what to think. railey failed to absorb his blunt  accusation, choosing instead to analyze it with detachment.  \"i\\'m aware that nobody can sit down with all the facts that are supposedly  known . . . and just make it all fit. that\\'s a frustration that everyone has  felt, including me,\" railey said.  \"confess,\" wright urged him. \"it will haunt you forever, it will drive you  crazy.\"  \"i don\\'t know if that\\'s a word of advice, a backhand comfort or what,\" railey  said. \"i\\'m not guilty. i didn\\'t do it. i don\\'t feel tormented by the guilt of  what i didn\\'t do.\"  on feb. 2, billie jo nicolai filed a legal bombshell in civil court, accusing  railey of \"maliciously\" attempting to kill his wife and orchestrating a \"clumsy  attempt\" to cover his actions with a phony alibi.  the lawsuit sought damages for \"physical and mental pain, disfigurement,  anguish and physical impairment\" on behalf of mrs. nicolai\\'s comatose daughter.  concern over the cost of peggy railey\\'s medical expenses was the overriding  reason for the action, but the family\\'s decision was also emotional, said  billie jo nicolai\\'s attorney, bill arnold.  \\'they are bitter\\'  \"they are bitter,\" he said. \"they are angry.\"  ted nicolai, peggy\\'s younger brother, revealed that railey had visited his wife  no more than three times and that after a christmas visit with his two  children, ryan had suffered severe emotional problems.  kinne, dallas\\' chief prosecutor, had sent an investigator to question ryan  about the night of april 21, and the youngster talked freely about almost  everything. but whenever the investigator asked about the attack, ryan would  tune her out. he would turn his back and try to leave the room.  railey moved to california, to a victorian flat not far from san francisco bay.  the rent reportedly was 1,600, and both he and papillon signed the lease.  initial attempts to serve railey with legal notice of the nicolai civil suit  were unsuccessful. eventually, he was spotted at a hotel, and papers were  slapped under the windshield wiper of a car driven by papillon, with railey  apparently slumped down inside.  precisely one year after the events of april, 1987, a state district judge  ruled that walker railey \"intentionally, knowingly, maliciously and brutally  attempted to strangle his wife\" and cover up his actions with a \"false alibi.\"  judge john whittington issued a preliminary civil judgment on april 22, 1988,  holding railey financially liable for the injuries to his wife. the extent of  damages would be determined later by a jury.  the ruling, although significant, had no bearing on the criminal investigation.  whittington\\'s action came after railey failed to respond to legal notices of  the suit. the judge said railey, by his technical default, had admitted all the  allegations.  fled bay area  railey could no longer be found. under siege from the media, he broke the lease  on the san francisco \"love nest\" he shared with papillon on her visits from  dallas. it appeared he had fled the bay area altogether.  \"the court can issue a subpoena that compels him to come answer my questions,\"  arnold said. \"but today, i have less of an idea where he is than at any time  since this case started.\"  in june, doctors reported a slight improvement in peggy railey\\'s condition and  she was returned to dallas and placed in the baylor institute for  rehabilitation.  dr. william parker, the institute\\'s medical director, said she could turn her  head and hear, but could not process what she heard.  \"if we can establish anything that seems to stimulate a response that could be  interpreted as functional, then we would continue to try, through repetition,  to improve on that,\" he said.  condition downgraded  parker said he didn\\'t think his team of specialists would be able to determine  whether peggy railey would ever communicate again.  \"i think the odds are probably going to be against it, but time is the only  thing that\\'s going to tell,\" he said.  after more than a year in a vegetative state, doctors downgraded her condition  to a \"persistent vegetative state,\" meaning, as a neurosurgeon explained, that  her chances for recovery were \"nil.\"  after two months in dallas, she was quietly returned to the nursing home in  tyler where her parents resumed their tender, but apparently hopeless, daily  care.  norm kinne sat puffing his pipe in the district attorney\\'s office and  reflecting on the railey case, his opinions no less candid than when he first  viewed the terrible pictures of peggy railey\\'s wounds.  \"this guy\\'s a liar,\" kinne said. \"he\\'s trying to cover his tracks. he wasn\\'t  where he was at the time he says he was. now the question is, if he wasn\\'t  there, where was he?  \"the conclusion that everybody\\'s drawn is that he was home choking out his  wife.  \"but that doesn\\'t necessarily follow. there\\'s no proof he was at the scene at  the time she was strangled. there\\'s no evidence that he strangled her or that  he knew who strangled her or that he arranged or participated in any way.\"  no concrete evidence  that\\'s not to say kinne didn\\'t think about prosecuting walker railey. he  visualized presenting all the evidence that showed railey lied, that he  contrived an alibi and that he told no one of visiting his girlfriend that  night.  but with a defense move for an instructed verdict of innocent, the judge might  ask, \"where is the evidence that he choked his wife?\" kinne said.  the trial would probably be over before it began.  as 1988 drew to an end, kinne had not surrendered hope that the case might  someday be solved, but any possibility was a long shot. peggy railey might  miraculously recover and identify her assailant, or even young ryan railey  might have seen something and be able to talk about it.  nothing incriminating  lucy papillon might eventually shed light on the case, but kinne once pointed  out that she had said nothing incriminating \"since we don\\'t have adultery laws  anymore.\"  for kinne, walker railey remained the ultimate enigma.  \"the last thing you\\'d expect from a guy like him would be to give up his wife  and kids and flit off to california. just say to hell with it and take off.  it\\'s just not what you\\'d expect from a man of his stature.  \"it gives every indication of guilt, whether he is guilty or not.\"  railey didn\\'t show  on dec. 5, judge whittington heard testimony in a one-day trial to determine if  walker railey should pay damages to the nicolai family. railey didn\\'t show up.  the family was awarded 16 million -- half to cover peggy\\'s care, half to  punish railey. it was a ruling more of symbolism than substance, a hollow  victory.  arnold said he didn\\'t know where railey was, or how much money he had. he  doubted that his wife\\'s family would ever collect the 16 million.  on videotape, the court watched therapists treating peggy railey, who has  virtually no body control and a haunting, lifeless look in her eyes.  still, her sister-in-law, linda nicolai, told of an experience at the hospital  one day that suggested the depth of peggy railey\\'s anguish.  as peggy\\'s wheelchair went down the hall, she passed a man exercising with a  cord similar to what police believe was used to choke peggy.  peggy railey began sweating, hyperventilating and rubbing her arms together.  linda nicolai added:  \"she kept looking at me . . . with this wild look on her face and trying to  tell me something.\"  ',\n",

       "  'text': 'the saudis, fewer petrodollars in their pockets and worried about security and  culture shock, have started looking for holidays at home and finding that there  is more to the country than sand.  in the oil price heyday of the 1970s, saudi muslims flocked to the kingdom\\'s  air terminals to escape the heat and monotony of the desert for the great  tourist capitals -- paris, london, new york and los angeles, the french and  spanish rivieras, istanbul and cairo.  but local tourism has been on the rise for the last five years, spearheaded by  a government campaign to encourage saudis to spend their vacation dollars at  home.  \"there are quite a lot of religiously conservative families who suffer when  they go abroad,\" said ibrahim al sayed, director general of tourism development  in the country\\'s mountainous southwest asir region. \"they don\\'t want their  teen-agers to copy westerners.\"  he added that many saudis are also acutely aware that language and cultural  barriers make them attractive victims for con artists abroad.  \"i\\'ve traveled in europe and i\\'ve faced some of the troubles,\" said fahd al  sayejh, public relations manager at the riyadh intercontinental hotel. \"my  family\\'s now looking for a villa in abha (in the cooler asir region). there are  many people who spend their summers there who used to go to europe.  \"it\\'s beautiful. it reminds us of the old days when we used to go to lebanon  every summer. the mountains are the same,\" he added. \"(but) in the oil boom  years, businessmen thought nothing of driving to the airport and boarding any  available international flight. now people are more aware of spending their  money.\"  tourism within saudi arabia may seem like a hard sell, given the country\\'s  reputation as a \"desert kingdom,\" lacking much in the way of amusement.  but beaches along the country\\'s eastern border on the persian gulf draw big  crowds.  jidda on the red sea attracts scuba-diving enthusiasts and najran, close to  yemen, offers unusual architecture. for a change of scenery, many tourists try  the southwest.  \"the whole southwest area is very popular,\" said antoni kuhnen, who runs the  al-baha motel in that region. kuhnen estimates that the motel, opened in 1985,  now books around 20,000 tourists a year.  al-baha, saudi arabia\\'s smallest province, is situated between taif, where the  government retreats into the mountains for the summer months, and abha, capital  of asir province, which boasts 1,736 square miles of national park.  a local newspaper noted that \"visitors to the abha region reached an  unprecedented number, to the extent that the real estate offices in abha cannot  cope with the great demand for furnished and unfurnished flats.\"  an estimated 800,000 visitors were reported to have made it despite a  relatively small airport.  the recent popularity of in-country tourism is due largely to the government.  five years ago, the few tourists who came to this region had to either camp out  or rely on the kindness of strangers for accommodation.  now, there are five hotels in the area, some of them bankrolled by the finance  ministry. private businessmen are also being encouraged to invest in tourism.  an amusement park would make the area more attractive to saudi families who  generally have large numbers of children to entertain, he said. land has  already been allocated, but awaits an investor.  al-baha does not lack scenic beauty. at nearly 10,000 feet above sea level, the  air is cool, crisp, and a bit damp -- a welcome change from just about anyplace  else in the kingdom during the summer months.  the mountains, rough, craggy, and dotted with scrubby green plants, rise  dramatically out of the tihama valley and are populated by shepherds tending  flocks of sheep and goats. baboons lope down the mountainside, carrying scraps  of food fed to them by motel staff and early rising guests.  \"as long as the facilities are there, the tourists will come,\" said kuhnen, who  nonetheless believes the region suffers for lack of recreational diversions.

       "  'text': 'just before sunset, the fishermen sail into fortaleza harbor on their rafts and  dump the day\\'s catch of mackerel, moray eels and red snappers on the sand.  people gather around shouting their bids.  fisherman raminundo nonato tavares comes away with 13,000 cruzados (about 13)  -- not bad for a day\\'s work, but nothing like the old times.  \"when i was a boy, we\\'d fish for half the time we do now and catch twice as  much,\" said tavares, who is 40 but whose weather-beaten face looks years older.  \"we used to come to port with the boat weighing low in the water from all the  fish,\" tavares said during a recent visit.  tavares is one of thousands of men on brazil\\'s northeast coast who for years  have been fishing on jangadas, or small wooden rafts, but who now see their  livelihood disappearing.  overfishing by big commercial trawlers and a boom in the shrimp trade, which  kills tons of fish, have been cutting into their catch and forcing many to seek  steadier work on trawlers.  about 200 jangadas now sail out of fortaleza harbor, where 20 years ago there  were about double that number, said wilson goncalves, president of the local  fishermen\\'s union in this city of 1.3 million people.  work is risky on a jangada, not much bigger than a double bed and powered only  by the wind, and the fishing season lasts only six months a year, as the sea is  too stormy in winter.  but jangadeiros, as the fishermen are known, cling to tradition.  they refuse the usual equipment for commercial fishing like motors, nets and  compasses, relying entirely on hook and line and a knowledge passed down from  generations of how to find the fish.  most are illiterate and, since their early teens, have never changed their  routine of sailing out to sea before dawn and returning before sunset.  they bring most of their catch home to their families and sell the rest to tide  them over during the winter months.  \"the jangadeiro does not understand or want technology. he\\'s a subsistence  fishermen who will rely on custom until the day he dies,\" said goncalves.  custom has well-served tavares and other jangadeiros for generations.  he can tell by the color of the water which fish will be most plentiful in a  certain area. darker, deeper water suggests the presence of mackerel, grouper  and -- if it\\'s a lucky day -- shark.  a green hue often means a coral reef lies below, and that means the moray eel,  which will bring tavares a high price because of its tasty meat and because  trawlers using nets rarely snare them.  using the weather, ocean currents and even the phases of the moon as his  guides, he says, he can almost always find the kind of fish he is seeking.  \"my father taught me most of it, but some of it i had to learn myself. the sea  is always changing,\" he said as he cast his line in a place that he thought  would yield red snapper, a small, ruddy fish. within half an hour, he had  caught five.  but the 20th century is closing in on the jangadeiros, who bitterly resent the  commercial trawlers they say are emptying their waters of fish.  \"so many fish in the ocean, and our share is so small after the fishing boats  come through,\" said francisco dos reis, who often joins tavares on his craft.  \"we used to be able to fill that basket with fish. now we\\'re lucky if we can  fill it halfway after a whole day at sea,\" dos reis said.  one reason for the drop in their catch is the boom in fortaleza\\'s shrimp  industry, which exports heavily to the united states.  when shrimp fishermen haul in their nets, they also bring in thousands of fish  that have gotten entangled and died. the fishermen throw them overboard  because, unlike the shrimp, fish won\\'t bring in coveted export dollars.

       "  'text': 'trapped in this northern lebanese valley, a forgotten community living by  tribal traditions thrives on smuggling goods across the river to syria.  despite the affluence this has brought, the bedouins of wadi khaled feel as if  they are prisoners in their own land, captive because of a historical mishap  that left them with no citizenship rights. their status has been \"under study\"  since 1968.  more than 50 years ago, the tribes\\' fear of officials drove the people to hide  in the woods. they missed lebanon\\'s only official census, conducted in 1932  when the country was still under french mandate. no population count has been  carried out since, so the status of the residents of wadi khaled is still  pending.  abu mustapha, clad in traditional arab headdress and gray gallabia, or  ankle-length shirt, said the tribesmen mistook census officials for envoys of  the ottoman empire authorities.  \"they hid in the woods because they were afraid their children would be drafted  into the ottoman army. they were illiterate people and did not understand that  we were not under ottoman rule anymore,\" said abu mustapha.  the bedouins of wadi khaled hold residence permits, issued to all foreigners  living in lebanon, and a document which classifies them in a \"citizenship under  study\" category.  unlike palestinians and other refugees in lebanon who have a special travel  document, these tribesmen have no passports and can travel almost nowhere.  syria is the only country that allows them inside its borders, just for brief  visits.  \"we have become prisoners in our own land,\" said sweid.  the people of wadi khaled -- named after khaled ibn al-walid, who drove out the  byzantine christians -- are divided into tribes who trace their origin to what  is now saudi arabia.  until the 1960s, they raised sheep in the bare rugged hills nearby. then they  turned to trade.  \"we are on the border between a socialist country (syria) and a country that  believes in free trade (lebanon),\" said bashir hammoud.  syria has strict import controls and the smuggled traffic across the nahr  el-bared river into the country includes television sets, radios, videos,  fruit, vegetables, canned food, coffee, sugar, building material, clothes and  shoes.  wadi khaled\\'s marketplace, al-arida, is a favorite of syrian families, with  prices given in syrian pounds that the merchants later change to dollars at the  rate of 46 to a dollar.  \"we sell here what syrians can only buy on the black market in their country.  everything they do not have they buy here,\" said hammoud.  the ghannam tribe, the largest and most influential, boasts that its standard  of living is higher than that of many people in the lebanese capital, beirut.  most of its members live in spacious cement houses with almost no furniture.  they traditionally prefer sitting on the floor.  khaled sweid, who holds a degree in mathematics, estimated that each family in  the ghannam tribe earned an average of about 200 per month compared to the  national minimum wage of 30 per month.  the residents of wadi khaled, all sunni muslims, have pleaded their case with  all the governments that have ruled lebanon since independence in 1943, but to  no avail.  christian politicians, who hold key posts in the government, have resisted  naturalizing 10,000 muslims because it could upset the sectarian balance in the  country.  \"our plight became the subject of bickering among politicians,\" said a ghannam  tribesman, one of a group squatting in a smoke-filled room and sharing a meal  of lamb and rice.  \"the solution for us lies with the lebanese government. but now which one do we  turn to?\"  ',\n",

       "  'text': 'in the land of 7 apples and 6 boxes of granola, matsutake mushrooms are in a  class of their own.  japanese drop their usual tones of careful politeness and become positively  rapturous in describing these unassuming brown fungi, their woodsy taste and  piney smell.  the owner of one of the world\\'s most exclusive restaurants, kicho, where meals  can run 800 a person and only an introduction from a previous customer can win  a reservation, recently wrote: \"in autumn we can almost not do our business  without matsutake.\"  but for the uninitiated, it is the price tag of the matsutake, or pine-tree  mushrooms, that is so breathtaking: a few inches high and, in fact, rather  mushroom-like in appearance, a single well-shaped matsutake can cost as much as  80 even an average one will run 40 per stem.  matsutake are so pricey and so prized that matsutake fraud has now entered the  japanese lexicon. recently it was discovered that some of these mushrooms were  being sold with tiny lead slivers inserted in their stems to inflate their  weight and thus their asking price.  worth it to japanese  for the japanese, who adore all manner of mushrooms and use about half a dozen  different varieties in their everyday food, the price is clearly worth it. \"i  love them,\" a japanese newspaper editor said recently, as he dropped the  subject at hand -- stock market manipulation -- to wax eloquent about  matsutake.  a japanese folk saying sums up the emotionalism toward matsutake: \"the mountain  where you picked matsutake cannot be forgotten.\"  with this saying in mind, a farming community troubled by a high rate of  bachelorhood among its young men recently held a matsutake-picking party in an  effort to entice women back to the farm.  according to mushroom connoisseurs, matsutake are expensive because their  season is short -- just a few weeks in late fall -- and because they can grow  only in the wild. japan\\'s wilderness has been disappearing steadily in the face  of relentless urbanization, and the red pine trees around which matsutake  flourish have also been diminishing.  not domesticated yet  the finest scientists have failed so far to domesticate the matsutake on a mass  scale, despite repeated efforts. mie ogoshi of japan\\'s tsuji cooking school  said that matsutake were much more common and much cheaper 20 years ago and  were used liberally in the kitchen. now, however, they are rationed  parsimoniously: paper-thin slices in a special broth, a few bits mixed in a  rice dish or a few grilled with a touch of lime and soy sauce. one special soup  features a little matsutake with a touch of real gold shavings.  demand for matsutake is so strong that the import-resistant japanese have  turned to south korea and china, where matsutake also grow and cost much less.  mushroom aficionados insist that these imports do not taste as good as local  ones among other drawbacks, to satisfy customs inspectors the matsutake must  be washed well, which attenuates their aroma, they say. nonetheless, every  fall, die-hard matsutake lovers figure that it is worth the price of a  tokyo-seoul round-trip ticket (about 500) to fill a few boxes with fresh  korean matsutake and lovingly carry them home.  still, even in affluent japan, there are many who find 80 per mushroom a bit  rich for the blood. one japanese woman who raved about the taste and autumnal  smell of matsutake admitted, after calming down, that she had not bought one in  15 years.  \\'like they are gold\\'  \"when you look at the price tag on the matsutake, it is like they are gold,\"  acknowledged ogoshi, of the cooking school. and like many high-priced foods in  japan, including the beautiful cantaloupe grown here and sold, individually  wrapped, for 80 or more, matsutake most often are given as presents.  for those who love their matsutake but cannot afford them, one enterprising  japanese company recently developed \"essence of matsutake,\" a small vial of  which costs only 2.50. the liquid can be poured on top of the lowly shiitake  or ma-shu-ru-mu (white american-style mushroom), allowing the diner to imagine  it is the real thing.  for the truly desperate, stores sell a few slices of matsutake for the  comparatively reasonable price of 20. when sniffed very closely they do give  off a piney odor. cooked -- one minute in a hot broiler or over a fire, with  drop of a little lime juice -- they taste, well, like a mushroom.

       "  'text': 'in northeastern afghanistan, small numbers of returned refugees have been  rebuilding their homes and replanting their terraced fields.  but not all the fields returned to the plow in the last year have been planted  with wheat and corn. many -- perhaps one out of every two -- were turned over  to the cultivation of marijuana and opium-producing poppies.  in fact, many western narcotics control officials, diplomats, some members of  the afghan resistance, and pakistani officials, are concerned that this region  could develop into the world\\'s leading producer of heroin -- the potent drug  derived from opium.  the primary source of opium for the west remains southeast asia\\'s \"golden  triangle\" -- burma, laos, and thailand. but since the mid-1980s, international  narcotics control sources say, the \"golden crescent\" of southwest asia has  gained prominence.  30% of market  together, afghanistan, pakistan, and iran account for at least 30% of the  united states heroin market, these sources estimate.  afghanistan, according to narcotics officials, is the region\\'s largest  producer. last year\\'s opium crop is estimated at between 500 and 700 tons. the  1988-89 poppy season, which normally begins with the first rains in december,  is expected to increase output by 100 to 200 tons. the reasons for  afghanistan\\'s increased production include: lack of government control in much  of the countryside during the nine-year war against soviet occupation  crackdowns on cultivation in pakistan, which have made afghanistan a safer  production center tehran\\'s apparent willingness to allow trafficking through  iran and growing demand in neighboring pakistan and the west.  for many peasants, white-and-pink poppy flowers are the easiest and most  lucrative cash crop. harvesting the sticky, black sap can bring a small farmer  up to 2,000 -- a fortune in this area. dealers take the opium by horse and  mule across the border into pakistan\\'s tribal border districts there, scores  of illicit laboratories process the opium into heroin.  difficult to control  \"we don\\'t have to be adam smith to realize we have a problem,\" says carlo  boccia, a representative of the u.s. drug enforcement administration in paris.  \"when drugs become more readily available, they become more difficult to  control.\"  western narcotics officials say they do not know how much of iran\\'s  \"tremendous\" poppy production reaches the international market. pakistan is  believed to have produced 200 or more tons of opium last year. most of the  region\\'s heroin is manufactured in pakistani labs. (ten pounds of opium produce  about one pound of pure heroin, which can sell for tens of thousands to a few  hundred thousand dollars in the west. heroin sold in the west is diluted, about  5% pure.)  one of the most severe effects of this rapidly growing regional trade, western  aid officials and other sources say, is its corrupting and undermining  influence on pakistani and afghan society. they cite:  * a rise in the number of pakistani addicts, most of whom \"chase the drag-on\"  (smoke heroin), from an estimated 200,000 in the early 1980s to between 1  million to 3 million today.  * the spread of heroin abuse among pakistan\\'s 3 million afghan refugees.  * corruption that involves senior pakistan government officials, army officers,  politicians, refugee administrators, businessmen, tribal leaders, and members  of the afghan resistance. this was alleged separately by narcotics and  intelligence officials, and western aid sources.  gang warfare feared  in addition, there are fears that the \"drug and gun culture\" on both sides of  the border could increase gang warfare. \"you have got to understand that it is  a huge business in this part of the world. there are terrible things going on,  and they involve a lot of people,\" says a worried representative of the afghan  resistance.  pakistan\\'s new prime minister, benazir bhutto, has described illegal drugs as  the country\\'s \"no. 1 problem\" and has created a ministry of narcotics to tackle  it. diplomats and aid workers are skeptical about chances for success.  \"the only reason we have not yet seen the sort of violence you find in colombia  (south america) is that enough people here are getting paid off to keep the  trade going,\" a western aid official says. \"the moment you start hitting where  it hurts, the situation will start getting nasty.\"  a route through karachi  narcotics from eastern and northern afghanistan and pakistan\\'s border areas are  channeled to karachi those from southern afghanistan go toward iran.  according to aid sources, trucks from the government-run national logistics  corporation, which normally carry goods to afghan refugee camps, often take  heroin to karachi.  \"there is a lot of direct collaboration with the police, the army, and the  refugee administration,\" says a western official.  for appearances, sources say, a vehicle is sometimes deliberately sacrificed to  the police. the rest then proceed unhindered to karachi, where the heroin is  taken by boat or plane to the mideast and europe.  berlin an entry point  some sources allege that officials in pakistan\\'s national shipping company are  involved. narcotics officials say east berlin, a drugs gateway in the 1970s, is  once again becoming a major entry point.  the production of opium in southwest afghanistan has come under the control of  local drug lords, cooperating closely with pakistani traffickers as well as  drug syndicates from europe and north america, intelligence sources say.  at musa qala, a fertile region in southern afghanistan, poppy growing is  largely run by nassim akhun zada, say journalists and relief workers who have  visited the area. zada is a guerrilla commander, reportedly still affiliated  with an afghan resistance party, the harakat-i-inqilab-i-islami, but who  operates largely on his own. western sources say zada leads a private army of  1,200 fighters. recently, there have been reports of pitched battles with a  rival, abdul rahman khan of the hizb-i-islami resistance party.  government role seen  from musa qala, part of the opium harvest is transported to eastern iran. but  most is taken to the pakistani desert refugee camps at gerde-jangal. there,  resistance and aid sources say, trafficking is carried out in collaboration  with officers of pakistan\\'s interservices intelligence (isi) organization.  at gerde-jangal, the opium is weighed and some is processed by local labs.  \"there is so much dealing going on that the money is not counted but weighed,\"  a western aid representative says. various sources, including a former  trafficker from quetta, say narcotics are driven in five-vehicle convoys -- two  carrying drugs, the other three armed guards and heavy machine guns -- through  government checkpoints, to robat.  robat is believed to have 20 or more heroin labs, from which the drug is driven  in armed convoys across southern iran to turkey and on to europe and america.  sources say the robat operations involve members of at least three afghan  resistance parties. it is uncertain whether party officials in quetta and  peshawar are linked to the trafficking.  foreigners are forbidden to enter robat \"for security reasons.\" some sources  claim that the aim is to prevent outsiders from witnessing what goes on.  \"it is perfectly obvious that this trafficking could not proceed without the  full knowledge of the isi (interservices intelligence) and the local pakistani  authorities,\" a west european diplomat says.

       "  'text': 'the expulsion of a radical slum priest from his ecclesiastic order has silenced  haiti\\'s most influential voice for the rights of the nation\\'s poor.  in expelling father jean-bertrand aristide, the conservative salesian order  accused the populist roman catholic cleric of fomenting class warfare, calling  him a \"protagonist of destabilization.\"  his ouster was announced dec. 15 in a statement from rome. although aristide  remains a priest, he cannot officiate at mass or deliver sermons over church  radio.  \"he has been neutralized,\" said sociologist franklyn midi.  outspoken campaigner  aristide, 35, a salesian priest since 1975, has been one of the most outspoken  campaigners for social justice in a country ruled for nearly its entire  184-year existence by dictators.  he has escaped at least three attempts on his life, including a sept. 11 attack  at his st. jean bosco church in a port-au-prince slum in which thugs armed with  machetes, guns, clubs and spears killed 12 people and wounded at least 70  others.  one week later, rank-and-file soldiers overthrew lt. gen. henri namphy in a  coup that put lt. gen. prosper avril in power. coup leaders said they wanted  democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored violence, citing the church  massacre as an example.  salesian officials expelled aristide after he failed to obey their order to  leave haiti by oct. 17 and assume a new post in canada.  popular protests  two previous transfer orders were rescinded because of popular protests.  thousands protested in support of aristide for several days in october, but  there were no immediate demonstrations after the expulsion.  aristide, who has been seen in public only once since the church massacre, has  made no public statement and has declined requests for interviews. but friends  say his morale is excellent and he might appeal the church decision.  despite its condemnation of military brutality and human-rights abuses in  haiti, the catholic hierarchy has long opposed aristide\\'s political  proselytizing of the poor.  a proponent of liberation theology, which advocates church involvement in a  political struggle by the poor against social injustice, aristide preaches  \"active nonviolence.\" he urges a \"real revolution\" to bring democracy to haiti,  but does not specifically propose an armed uprising.  fire and brimstone  his pulpit style is that of a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose leading  questions prompt quick responses from the congregation. the sermons were  broadcast nationwide and earned aristide a huge following among the urban poor  and the rural peasantry, who call the bespectacled ascetic their \"prophet.\"  although civic leaders and many priests applauded aristide\\'s crusade, the  church hierarchy apparently feared the possible consequences of radicalizing  the masses.  \"the upper and middle classes, of course, have heaved a sigh of relief,\" midi  said of aristide\\'s ouster. \"they are uncomfortable when the voice of the poor  is raised too high.\"  \"what they have not understood is that aristide has contained the resentment of  the impoverished masses by giving it a religious form,\" midi added. \"he has not  sent them into the streets but drawn them into the church.\"  bishops were worried  a salesian spokesman in rome, father joseph aubrey, told the voice of america  that the expulsion was ordered because haitian \"bishops worried about the  results of aristide\\'s action.\"  but father serge miot, secretary of haitian bishops council, denied that the  council had asked the salesians to expel aristide.  the effective silencing of aristide coincides with a move by avril to tighten  army discipline after a purported oct. 14 coup attempt. since then, the  government has imprisoned or discharged dozens of soldiers for alleged  insubordination.  leftist politicians have accused the government of clamping down on the most  progressive element in the army -- soldiers angered by the slow progress in  bringing about the democratic reforms avril promised when he became president.  had become a symbol  it is not known what role, if any, the government had in aristide\\'s ouster but  to some, the priest has become a symbol of the democratic struggle.  \"aristide was discharged from his religious order in the same way that soldiers  faithful to the sept. 17 reform movement have been discharged from the army,\"  said paul dejean, a haitian author and social worker, referring to those who  participated in the coup to gain democratic reforms.  \"people who believe in the gospel values of liberation, liberty and justice are  penalized and punished,\" he said.

       "  'text': 'the scantily dressed dancers are long gone. the last liquor store was blown up  six years ago. this ancient roman city now is the lebanese capital of shia  muslim fundamentalism.  public drinking and dancing are forbidden now, but brief male-female unions  called \"pleasure marriages\" are condoned.  on the surface at least, life in baalbek is governed by the dictates of  ayatollah ruhollah khomeini\\'s stern brand of islamic fundamentalism in iran,  which to western eyes appears joyless and forbidding.  wearing makeup or jewelry in public is taboo. so is singing and dancing at  mixed gatherings because, as one woman noted, \"it causes psychological  imbalance and tempts men.\"  but when the sun goes down and the doors are locked, the black robe-like  chadors shia women have to wear in public are discarded in favor of shorts and  strapless tops, along with makeup and perfume.  \"people think we\\'re made of stone just because we cover ourselves with chadors.  but we\\'re not. we\\'re ready to do anything to please our husbands,\" said selma,  a housewife.  before lebanon\\'s civil war erupted in 1975, baalbek was a cultural center where  dance and theatrical festivals were held in the breathtaking roman  amphitheaters.  now the ruins echo with islamic slogans as the fundamentalists stage political  rallies there, chanting ritual denunciations of \"death to america! death to  israel!\" the amphitheaters have also been used as mortar positions in lebanon\\'s  sectarian fighting.  the shias\\' strict life style has drawn bitter criticism from many lebanese,  muslims and christians alike who say that the fundamentalists\\' \"double  standards\" have brought islam into disrepute.  most shias in baalbek belong to hezbollah (party of god), which is believed to  be an umbrella for shia kidnapers holding most of the 16 foreigners missing in  lebanon. it\\'s made up of zealots blindly loyal to khomeini.  \"we follow whatever khomeini decrees. whatever he rejects, we reject,\" said  zeinab nasser, an administrator at the women\\'s \"haouzeh,\" or religious center,  in baalbek.  the practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs frowned on by  other lebanese, especially moderate shias and sunnis.  in a pleasure marriage, a young woman who would not dare expose a curl of her  hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited number of lovers in the  name of religion.  but most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are considered  respectable and far from promiscuous.  the practice is widespread in iran, where the overwhelming majority of the 54  million population is shia.  nasser said the prophet mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage, making it  acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period that could last \"for an  hour, two days, a month or as long as they desire.\"  \"it\\'s all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child born after the  marriage contract expires,\" she explained.  she said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid lebanon\\'s economic  crisis because \"men cannot afford a regular marriage, and let\\'s face it, they  have physical needs.  \"if these cannot be met within a permanent marriage, pleasure marriage provides  the outlet,\" she added. \"it\\'s much better than doing it illicitly.\"  no cleric is required to perform the ceremony. the woman, who should preferably  be either divorced or widowed, tells the man, \"i give myself to you in  pleasure.\"  he responds: \"i accept.\" and that\\'s it.  virgins need the consent of their parents, but they often do not seek it.  as for forms of entertainment, the fundamentalists permit classical music  \"because it does not have any negative psychological effects,\" nasser said.  she observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is bad for \"the  nerves and the blood circulation.\"  like other factions in lebanon, where the government has collapsed, the shias  have established their own medical and welfare systems, amply funded by iran.  abbas mousavi, a hezbollah leader, said: \"social work has become one of our  main responsibilities because of the catastrophes that have befallen lebanon.  \"we\\'ve founded the imam khomeini hospital here, which provides free medical  treatment. there are similar centers in other shia areas.\"  he noted: \"we\\'ve also founded pharmacies that make a very small profit, as well  as schools, which we hope will accommodate 6,000 students in the near future.  \"we\\'ve given money to needy families and bought deep-bore drills to provide  wells in remote villages, especially those we consider to have military or  political importance.\"  asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and nightclubs, mousavi  noted: \"we\\'re not imposing islamic values on people. no one can say we\\'ve  raided houses where people gamble or drink.\"  asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs, he conceded: \"there were  incidents where young men acted out of islamic zeal after witnessing aberrant  behavior. but hezbollah is against that.\"  ',\n",

       "  'text': 'about 150 miles from bogota lie the mines of muzo and coscuez, the biggest  emerald deposits in the world. the car drive from the colombian capital over a  potholed track takes eight to 10 hours.  to santa barbara, a small town 5 miles from the mining centers, the land is a  lush green. thereafter, the terrain is a gray bleakness. the wild mountain  peaks are covered from morning until evening in a cloak of mist as if nature  seeks to hide its treasures.  the houses in santa barbara are made of wood, despite the millions of pesos to  be made in the town every day. there are no hotels, not even hostels for the  simple traveler. yet the finest and most expensive scotch flows, and fortunes  are squandered in the town\\'s bars and dives.  the neighboring town of muzo usually has about 5,000 residents, but during an  emerald boom -- and that happens whenever a new seam is discovered -- the  population soars to 20,000.  warnings issued  for those unacquainted with the land, the journey into the mining zone can be  extremely dangerous. tourists are warned to stay away. the area has been dubbed  the \"land of 1,001 nights\" and the \"devil\\'s caldron.\"  wild rags-to-riches stories go the rounds in muzo and coscuez, where  millionaires have been made overnight. thousands of adventurers have lost their  lives in bloody fighting among themselves. numerous crosses planted by the  roadside or dotting the fields are silent testimony to the violence.  the emerald is a form of beryl, a mineral found principally in granite and  granite pegmatites. it is prospected in its pure form as a precious stone and  is green or blue-green in color.  \"the most valuable are the so-called \\'oil drops\\' and \\'water eyes,\\' veritable  masterpieces of nature for which vast sums are paid,\" explained a jeweler in  bogota.  the precious stones prospected in muzo and coscuez are sent to bogota to be  valued by experts. shine, purity and color determine the price.  emerald mines can also be found in brazil, africa, australia, india and the  soviet union. japan even produces synthetic emeralds.  state owns resources  the deposits in colombia were mined in pre-columbian times. the present  official prospector, the compania esmeraldas de colombia, holds the concession  from the state, which owns all mineral resources in the country.  the question of how much emerald is actually found in colombia each year is  difficult to answer, as great quantities of the precious stone disappear onto  the black market.  official figures put the annual legal export of emeralds at 36.3 million.  however, insiders reckon that between 100 million and 150 million worth of  colombian emeralds are marketed each year.  the price of the stone depends on many factors, including ever-changing supply  and demand, and the fluctuating rate of the dollar. prospective purchasers are  advised not to buy from strangers in the street, but to go to a respected  jeweler.  distinguishing a fake from the real thing is not an easy task, even for the  experts. many a traveler has returned home with worthless glass instead of a  valuable gem.

       "  'text': 'it is 11 p.m. white-coated technicians shuffle in surgical clogs from tubes to  beakers, inspecting the quality of anti-tuberculosis pills rattling out of a  molding machine at a rate of 40,000 per hour.  this isn\\'t the late shift. it is the only shift at \"eplf pharmaceuticals,\" a  lab housed inside four giant shipping crates 300 miles from the nearest  independent electricity supply.  outside in a remote valley in eritrea in northern ethiopia, crickets and frogs  join buzzing mosquitoes and the noise of foxes chasing african hares over the  boulders. civet cats and gray owls watch from stunted, moonlit trees.  inside, technicians of the eritrean people\\'s liberation front produce no less  than 37 varieties of pills, capsules, ointments and liquids to be packed into  brown bottles marked \"eplf drug production and research\" over a logo of a cobra  wrapped round a pharmacist\\'s pestle.  the 5-year-old drug venture is just one of many backup industries supporting  the eplf\\'s 27-year-old guerrilla war for independence from ethiopia. they  produce souped-up automobile engines, machine tools, truck bodies, molded  shoes, textbooks, pamphlets, flour-milling machines, macaroni, spaghetti and  even sanitary towels.  safety of darkness  like the watch and electrical repair shops and the tank and truck garages, they  are heavily camouflaged and operate under the safety of darkness, free of the  threat of bombardment from ethiopian mig warplanes.  all are staffed by trained personnel, many graduates, working without salary as  their contribution to the massive, centralized war effort.  the pharmaceutical factory is the centerpiece of the key eplf doctrine of  self-reliance and self-sufficiency, forced on it by years of isolation from  external support.  basic chemicals are imported from europe to make a range of the most frequently  used preparations against diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. the eplf  factories produce about 40% of the basic list of 187 eplf-approved drugs  covering tetracycline antibiotics, sulfanilamides, vitamins, iron supplements,  anti-parasitic, paracetamol and aspirin compounds.  even limited current production is reckoned to be worth more than 750,000 a  year -- 310,000 in sterile solutions for drips and major surgery alone.  more shipping containers  plans are afoot to boost capacity -- with the aid of more shipping containers  and plentiful mud -- to 80% of total drug needs.  the laboratory and its integrated research department, run by an eritrean  pharmacist trained in ethiopia and the united states, is hidden conveniently  close to the eplf\\'s main hospital at arota in northern eritrea.  the hospital is a huge complex, able to treat 800 to 1,000 patients in small  units dug into rock, camouflaged and spaced for safety along 5 miles of narrow  valley. it links a network of provincial hospitals, civilian clinics and medic  stations concealed near the battle fronts.  about 99% of eplf, civilian and ethiopian prisoner casualties can be treated  for almost every kind of ailment and wound in this health system.  neighboring valleys hold mechanical and electrical shops equipped with lathes  and specialist machinery to service and substitute even the heaviest industrial  plant for both civilian and military needs. that includes giant generating  units to supply basic power.  italian moulding machine  footwear was a headache until eritreans working abroad donated an italian pvc  injection molding machine eight years ago. it now cranks out 100 hot pairs of  black plastic sandals an hour.  the plastic base granules are imported but -- saving a penny as ever -- 20% of  the plastic input is recycled from machine waste and old sandals collected from  fighters in the field. black was not a color chosen on considerations of  fashion.  \"white wouldn\\'t do for camouflage reasons,\" said a sandal worker. \"black is the  most convenient in that respect.\"  italian colonists who founded an eritrean state in the late 19th century left  little transport infrastructure. most major eritrean towns are connected by  poor dirt roads, but these are largely off limits to eritrean supply convoys  because of possible land mines and the threat from ethiopian warplanes.  movements of huge amounts of munitions and tons of gasoline required  alternative networks. in physical terms, this was probably the greatest  challenge and is the greatest concrete achievement of the eritrean liberation  movement.  hostile, rocky landscapes  hundreds of miles of tracks capable of taking large trailer trucks have been  driven through hostile, rocky landscapes. most are hidden in dry, winding river  beds, but shortcuts have been driven over 6,000-foot mountains with hairpin  turns that would dizzy a swiss.  \"in the early days we cut those passes with sweat, shovels and picks,\" said a  veteran fighter. \"these days, it\\'s a bit different.\"  the rebels now have bulldozers, grading machines and blasting powder,  supplemented by the combined muscle of some 12,000 ethiopian prisoners of war.  like the stiff-lipped britons of the \"bridge over the river kwai\" movie, they  appear to take a perverse pride in their contribution to the eritrean revolt.  garages dot the supply routes. they have vulcanizing units, welding and brazing  tackle, compressors and machine lathes capable of turning out replacement  pistons and rings with critical tolerances.  some specialize like western car dealers in particular models such as toyota  landcruisers, olive green four-wheel-drive moskovitches or monolithic soviet  trucks designed to haul outsize field guns on tires 2 feet thick.  chipped coke bottles  the parsimonious efficiency of the eplf backup operation, in which precious  little is thrown away, defies cataloguing. scraps of waste bread piled on  sheets outside every field kitchen are not for the birds -- dried, they form  the must and yeast for fermentation of a heady wheat beer served in chipped  coke bottles.  in the ruined central eritrean town of nacfa, flattened by 10 years of almost  daily bombing and now a gaunt symbol of the resistance, a 133-millimeter shell  case hung on a string with a stick on a tumbledown wall is a makeshift alarm  bell.  like swords turned into plowshares, finned back sections of huge unexploded  bombs form mountings for drills and metal cutters. rocket casings become  charcoal grills and cooking knives. door jambs, window frames, bunker roofing  and furniture invariably are fashioned from wooden ammunition boxes.  donated burlap grain sacks are transformed into curtains and rugs, sun awnings,  roof insulation and false ceilings. usaid sacks are particularly popular. they  are often made from a close-woven, almost waterproof plastic and make warm  mattresses.  at the swarming ethiopian pow camps, bored but grateful inmates fritter away  hot hours around noon with playing cards cut from pasteboard ammunition  packing.  as the sun cools they stir and, helped enthusiastically by rebel guards as sick  as their charges with a monotonous dry diet devoid of anything fresh or green,  they tend cabbage, capsicum, courgette and spinach developed on eplf  agricultural research stations.  the golden revolutionary rule is that nothing comes on a plate. the eritreans  have no alternative to self-reliance.

       "  'text': 'when caterer david zafferelli joined the throngs at nordstrom\\'s new downtown  san francisco store in october, he dropped 150 on two flannel shirts and  another 150 for bubbly and beluga caviar at the store\\'s champagne exchange  bar.  \"we just thought that was as much fun as shopping,\" he said. \"i\\'ll always go  for any excuse to drink champagne and eat caviar.\"  increasingly, shoppers who stop to nosh at department stores are finding chic,  newfangled eateries in place of the proper tearooms and restaurants of their  childhoods. whereas patrons in the early part of the century sipped tea and  nibbled cucumber sandwiches, customers of upscale department stores today are  more likely to have espresso and cookies or cornish game hen and chardonnay or  mesquite-grilled chicken and pasta salad.  the shifts in department store food service reflect a fundamental change in the  philosophy of shoppers, observers say. in the old days, people would make  shopping an all-day event, with a leisurely lunch or tea break built in. today,  with time-starved but hard-working baby boomers hankering for service and  quality, the right restaurant can serve not only as a lure but also as an  incentive to linger in the store. and shoppers such as zafferelli have proved  willing to spend liberally for the ambiance.  of course, old-fashioned tearooms still exist, and some, such as those at  bullocks wilshire and bullock\\'s pasadena, are thriving, particularly at holiday  time. but many stores in recent years have turned these genteel anachronisms  into stylish cafes or bistros where customers come year-round just to dine,  never mind the shopping.  \"the \\'80s has brought us into a whole different era,\" said robert j. nyman,  president of george lang corp., a new york firm that develops restaurant  concepts. \"most stores today are using food service as an amenity that has to  do with the total marketing of the store.\"  with department stores undergoing sweeping changes of late, many retailers,  particularly downtown merchants that must compete with ubiquitous suburban  malls, have strived to hold onto or devise unique operations that make them a  destination. restaurants often fill the bill, even if they don\\'t contribute  heartily to the bottom line.  at the new nordstrom in san francisco, for example, the marble-topped champagne  bar has become a draw for upscale customers, as has an authentic english pub  modeled on one at harrods in london. at the flagship bloomingdale\\'s in  manhattan, the premier dining spot among half a dozen eateries is le train  bleu, a re-creation of a luxury orient express-type dining car. the dayton  hudson department stores in the midwest are expanding a marketplace foods  concept that offers carry-out pasta, stir-fried dishes, freshly baked breads  and frozen yogurt to busy downtown workers.  unlike their tearoom predecessors, which usually were situated in a store\\'s  highest reaches, these food outlets are often stashed next to fashion  departments. and they are a far cry from the formica-topped counters prevalent  at five-and-dime and discount stores.  \"the opportunities for food in department stores are the best they\\'ve been in  over 20 years,\" said john d. lovelace, central director of food services for  dayton hudson in minneapolis. \"people eat every day, but they don\\'t shop every  day.\"  food service has gone in and out of favor with retailers over the last few  decades, and even today retailers\\' philosophies differ widely.  \"it is a very mixed bag,\" said charles j. leven, senior vice president,  director of operations at saks fifth avenue in new york. \"some companies are  cutting back, a few are expanding.\" saks intends to open its first restaurant  at the flagship manhattan store next year, leven said, after customers clamored  for food service.  \\'quick food\\' concepts  until about 1950, large department stores catering to the carriage trade  typically used a chunk of their space for tearooms. in the 1960s, the  popularity of such rooms declined, and many started losing money. as real  estate became more valuable in the 1970s, merchants began devoting the space to  clothing and other items that were more profitable. at the same time, many  stores were going into suburban malls that had abundant sit-down restaurants or  fast-food outlets in so-called food courts.  then women went to work in record numbers and the population became more health  and diet conscious. fewer people had the time or inclination to spend a  leisurely afternoon at their favorite tearoom. that gave rise to a variety of  \"quick food\" concepts in stores catering to customers for whom money was less  of an object than convenience and quality.  nordstrom plunged into the food business 10 years ago after having leased space  for years to a small chain of restaurants. it now has 70 food outlets in 58  stores, most under the names espresso bar and cafe express, featuring fresh  soups and salads.  faced with having to attract shoppers to a seedy location three blocks from  union square in san francisco, nordstrom decided to go in for some culinary  theatrics in its newest store.  \"we wanted to create little pockets of fun,\" said jim dickinson, general  manager of the seattle-based chain\\'s restaurant division. \"we also wanted to  create a reason for people to stay in our stores rather than get out to our  competitors.\"  the pub, strategically placed next to the men\\'s department, is modeled on the  green man at harrods in london, an innovative retailer that houses about 20  food outlets and a massive food hall where londoners and tourists alike buy  pricey groceries. the nordstrom room features stools covered with forest green  leather, a plank floor made of kentucky barn wood, a healthy selection of  imported and domestic beers and television monitors.  if the pub idea proves successful, dickinson said, nordstrom plans to expand it  into other new stores nationwide. the chain also is considering a \"bread basket  concept\" that would sell freshly baked goods and small open-face sandwiches,  already dubbed nordwiches.  the store\\'s champagne exchange was designed to offer a high return. it takes up  less space by far than would a traditional tearoom yet affords a high markup on  its caviar and 103 champagne varieties. the concept \"enables the customer to  spend a lot of money,\" dickinson said. \"we do find, particularly in san  francisco, it doesn\\'t bother people to be drinking a 9 glass of champagne.\"  lots of flash  the chain also this holiday rolled out its nordstrom select pantry, a selection  of gift food items developed in its restaurants.  overall, dickinson said, nordstrom\\'s restaurant operations account for 1.5% of  the chain\\'s annual sales (which last year totaled nearly 2 billion) yet 22% of  its transactions, indicating that food tabs are generally far lower than those  for other purchases.  bloomingdale\\'s flagship store in new york also goes in for selling sizzle along  with its steaks. \"the restaurants at bloomingdale\\'s have evolved into unique  concepts in tune with the eating public,\" said will hellemeyer, director of  food service. \"we are what people expect of restaurants in the \\'80s . . . and  not what they expect to find in a department store restaurant.\"  after renovating the housewares department several years ago, the store was  left with a long, narrow space on an intermediate level between two floors. a  store designer came up with the idea of copying a luxury dining car, complete  with green velvet chairs, white linen tablecloths and brass chandeliers.  le train bleu (named for a midnight blue engine), which opened in 1978, is \"a  continental restaurant that competes with restaurants on the east side of  manhattan and is rated in dining guides,\" hellemeyer said. with seating for 64,  the restaurant features such specialties as calf\\'s liver with cassis and  shallots, grilled cornish game hen stuffed with foie gras and wild rice and  grilled swordfish with sun-dried tomato butter. average tab: 20.  among other bloomie\\'s food service operations, hellemeyer said, are forty  carrots, a \"healthy food\" restaurant in which the store years ago introduced  frozen yogurt to the new york market showtime cafe, an upscale cafeteria  similar to cafe casino, and espresso bar, \"a euro-chic italian cafe\" offering  desserts, fresh pastas, salads and wines.  the decision whether to offer food service is usually based on a store\\'s  location and bottom line. store officials would not talk about their  restaurants\\' financial results, but they acknowledged that food service is an  expensive proposition.  the food business \"in general has lower margins than most other merchandise in  a department store,\" said ken stevens, a consultant with the los angeles office  of mckinsey &amp co. it comes down to a trade-off, with the retailer  determining whether the intangible benefits of offering the service outweigh  the reduced profitability.  at marshall field\\'s in chicago, for instance, the legendary walnut room -- a  restaurant in the old tradition -- is not considered a big profit maker \"other  than that it\\'s a big draw,\" said homer g. sharp, head of central display.  \"obviously, people go shopping while they\\'re here.\"  some end food service  with a typical sit-down eatery costing between 500,000 and 1 million to  install, many retailers, may co. california among them, are inclined to put  restaurants into free-standing stores but not into those mall locations served  by a food court. another consideration is space: new department stores tend to  be far smaller than the huge stores of years past and have less space to spare  for low-return businesses.  bonwit teller, a fashion specialty store, has phased out its food business.  until its purchase by may department stores two years ago, robinson\\'s was  making a big push into food service. now, it has only three food outlets  chain-wide, all of them leased.  in designing its newest stores, including those in los angeles and palm desert,  bullock\\'s left out restaurants. and when the chain remodeled its santa ana  location, the restaurant was removed.  the tearoom in bullock\\'s pasadena, according to james b. brooks, the store\\'s  general manager, is the chain\\'s most profitable food service operation and  lately has been expanding its successful banquet business. even so, the tearoom  recently eliminated its evening food service, primarily because of increased  restaurant competition in pasadena.  one of the biggest proponents of food is dayton hudson department store co.,  which claims to have the largest upscale food service among u.s. department  stores, serving 12 million patrons a year.  when lovelace, the food service director, joined the company in 1982, he  immediately set about developing new \"upscale fast-food\" concepts and  transforming the company\\'s traditional sit-down restaurants \"to meet the needs  of the customer of the \\'80s.\"  among other operations, the company came up with yogurt express, which  generates a hefty 1,000 in sales per square foot (compared to about 200 for  non-food merchandise) and is being rolled out to several of the company\\'s 37  stores 700 express, designed to serve customers quality fast food within 10  minutes, and a combination of five quick food concepts that replaced the  flagship minneapolis store\\'s traditional sky room and quickly tripled sales.  the company is also expanding its 4-year-old marketplace foods, similar to  macy\\'s cellar in new york, with a substantial carry-out area.  reflecting customers\\' rapidly changing palates, ethnic foods are playing a  bigger role in dayton hudson\\'s offerings. forget the cling peach halves,  cottage cheese and iceberg lettuce leaves of yore. new menus offer morocco  salad, made with boneless chicken breast and couscous (6), and smoked salmon  with radicchio, bibb lettuce, avocado, grapefruit, chopped egg and caviar,  dayton hudson\\'s most expensive salad at 7.  the broadway, too, has found that its customers\\' changing tastes have forced it  to adapt quickly to new trends. it recently closed a traditional sit-down  restaurant at its brea mall store in favor of a deli service with lighter fare.  \"we . . . have seen a really remarkable response,\" said richard f. clayton,  president.  \\'food is fashion\\'  unlike bullock\\'s, the broadway has put food service operations into its newest  stores, but it also recently closed restaurants in beverly center and baldwin  hills where it \"couldn\\'t come up with a formula that worked,\" clayton said. the  43-store chain now operates 24 food facilities, serving more than 2 million  diners a year.  \"that\\'s a lot of transactions,\" clayton said. \"it\\'s important because we touch  a lot of customers.\"  meanwhile, food service, once the province of large department stores, has also  spread to smaller specialty apparel boutiques such as koala blue, with its  australian-style milk bars fred segal, which has restaurants at stores in  santa monica and on melrose avenue merry go round, a chain selling young men\\'s  and women\\'s apparel that is testing a \\'50s-style diner and soda fountain in a  store in denver, and barneys, an exclusive women\\'s clothier in manhattan that  has le cafe, a buffet and bistro bar with about 90 seats.  to dickinson of nordstrom, the merging of menus and merchandise makes sense.  \"we consider ourselves a fashion retail store, and we believe food is fashion,\"  he said. \"there is tremendous opportunity for good dining.\"  ',\n",

       "  'text': 'dick haddon\\'s church has an identity problem.  \"i tell people that the first united methodist church of gardena is not in  gardena,\" the rev. haddon said, \"and people just kind of stare in disbelief.  \"this is gardena, but it\\'s not. even the post office says \\'gardena,\\' but the  reality is, we do not live in gardena. . . . if we had a fire . . . the  response would come from the city of los angeles.\"  that is a complicated fact of life in harbor gateway, the 8-mile long,  4-block-wide umbilical cord acquired at the turn of the century to link los  angeles to its port.  in a city where community names conjure up images -- venice, silver lake, boyle  heights -- harbor gateway draws a blank.  bounded on the west by gardena and torrance and on the east by carson and  unincorporated county land, the area was for decades known as the \"city strip,\"  the \"shoestring strip\" or, simply, \"the strip.\"  area rechristened  four years ago, the los angeles city council rechristened the area to try to  bring a sense of identity and community pride to its citizens -- some of whom  do not even know they live in los angeles.  harbor gateway lacks much of what makes a community a community -- no central  business district, no civic center or gathering place, no library branch, no  police station and, as haddon noted, no post office. its largest park is a  cemetery. and, despite the new name, mailing addresses of residents remain  unchanged. they still say torrance or gardena, not los angeles.  not surprisingly, this leaves some people confused.  \"they say, \\'look, my mailing address is gardena,\\' \" reported gene painter, the  city of gardena\\'s superintendent of human services who said he does not turn  away harbor gateway residents who ask for help. \"strange as it may seem, they  don\\'t know where they live.\"  optician chris toughill joined the torrance chamber of commerce when he opened  his shop in a harbor gateway strip mall, and his neighbors did the same. it  wasn\\'t until the torrance mayor declined to attend their grand opening,  toughill said, that the merchants discovered that they were in los angeles.  even the young toughs of the gardena 13 gang, interviewed while hanging out on  a harbor gateway street corner, insisted they were standing in gardena.  in population, harbor gateway is tied with westwood as los angeles\\'  second-fastest growing area. sylmar is first. between 1980 and 1986, according  to los angeles planning department estimates, harbor gateway\\'s population  increased 15.6%, from 30,238 to 34,951.  a drive through the gateway is like a trip from the city to the suburbs. on the  north end, which begins at el segundo boulevard, there are apartments needing  repair, gang graffiti on walls and single-family homes with barred windows. the  southern end -- which stops at sepulveda boulevard, where harbor city begins --  is punctuated by newly built strip malls, condominiums and well-manicured  lawns.  property values follow a similar pattern, with the lowest prices in the north.  home values in nearby torrance or gardena, however, are considerably higher.  real estate agents report that a house in harbor gateway might sell for as much  as 50,000 less than one across the street in another community.  agents attribute the difference to better city services, particularly in  torrance, which has its own schools.  \"the minute you mention los angeles,\" said gardena real estate agent john  warner, \"it frightens . . . people away. it\\'s just one of those things. homes  have always been cheaper over there (harbor gateway).\"  said resident betty roy: \"i hate to be known to live in the strip. when my  friends ask where i live, i tell them torrance.\"  indeed, four years after the name change -- in spite of spiffy blue-and-white  signs that declare \"harbor gateway\" below the los angeles city seal -- those  who live and work there say they still feel betwixt and between, not fully a  part of los angeles, harbor gateway or the bordering cities.  \\'in limbo\\'  moreover, they complain that their new moniker has not brought with it what  they really want: more attention from city officials, better services such as  street cleaning and tree trimming and, above all, increased police protection.  \"we\\'re like in limbo,\" said roy, a longtime resident of the gateway\\'s southern  end. \"we\\'re not really torrance and we\\'re not really carson. . . . we\\'re only  here because los angeles needs this little piece of land to attach to the  harbor. nobody cares about us. . . . we\\'re like the forgotten people.\"  for sylvia figueroa, life on the border means a daily struggle at it\\'s a  miracle, the mexican pizza parlor she opened a year ago at gardena boulevard  and vermont avenue in los angeles.  the city of gardena is across the street, and the differences are stark. on the  gardena side, gardena boulevard -- that city\\'s main business thoroughfare -- is  getting a face lift. the street is clean, and the trees are neatly trimmed.  city officials are offering grants to business owners for renovations.  neighborhood contrasts  across the street in los angeles, the trees are scraggly and overgrown,  vagrants sleep in a littered vacant lot, liquor stores abound and the gardena  13 gang seems to own the corner.  \"the other side there\\'s no drunk people, no people looking for drugs,\" said  figueroa, who sweeps her sidewalk regularly. \"the other side is so clean. even  the sidewalk is clean.  \"you see the street?\" she asked, pointing to a pile of litter. \"that\\'s  terrible.\"  los angeles city councilwoman joan milke flores, who represents the area,  conceded that the gateway is not getting its share of services.  \"it\\'s difficult to get a library in there, because no matter where you put a  library in the gateway, you only serve a limited number of city residents,\" she  said. \"it\\'s difficult to get a street cleaning service on a regular basis  because they have to come from somewhere else to get there. . . . it\\'s not like  having a nice, round community where you have something in the middle and it  serves everybody around it.\"  the united way apparently agrees. in march, the umbrella agency\\'s  harbor/southeast division declared harbor gateway an \"under-served geographic  area,\" citing \"real gaps in law enforcement\" and social services.  the declaration is part of a long-term plan by the united way to upgrade harbor  gateway by organizing neighborhood leaders to form nonprofit programs for  residents.  a citizens group, chaired by haddon, is setting goals for the project,  apparently marking the first time that community leaders around the gateway  have come together to talk about the area\\'s problems. the minister and some  others agree that the first goal should be improving community pride and  cohesiveness to create political clout.  to do that, residents must reverse 82 years of history.  over the years, since the so-called shoestring strip annexation of dec. 26,  1906, harbor gateway residents have somehow coalesced into five distinct  neighborhoods. from north to south, their rough boundaries are el segundo  boulevard to rosecrans avenue rosecrans to redondo beach boulevard redondo  beach to artesia boulevard artesia to 190th street and 190th street to  sepulveda boulevard. the east-west boundaries of the three northern  neighborhoods are vermont avenue and figueroa street, while western and  normandie avenues bound the two in the south.  overall, harbor gateway is a racially mixed, middle-income area, with an  estimated median household income of 30,431 and a population that is 48.4%  white, 13.2% black, 16.5% asian and 21.8% other racial groups, according to the  1980 census, the most recent statistics available.  latinos -- whose numbers are not tallied as part of the racial breakdown in the  1980 census -- are harbor gateway\\'s largest minority group, accounting for  32.9% of the overall population, according to census data.  however, the picture changes when the area is more closely examined.  demographic statistics show that the various gateway neighborhoods often  resemble adjacent communities more closely than they do one another.  for example, the two gateway neighborhoods near south south-central los angeles  and compton have the heaviest concentration of blacks, 44.7%. whites make up  23.6% of those two neighborhoods, which extend north from redondo beach  boulevard, and asians make up 6.9%. the estimated median household income there  is 27,453.  make-up of community  but in the strip\\'s midsection, from artesia boulevard to 190th street, the  population reflects that of the southern end of gardena, which is heavily  asian. there, the black population is minuscule -- just 0.4% -- with most of  the population split between whites, 48.1%, and asians, 44.8%. estimated  household income in this section jumps dramatically, to 44,498.  and south of 190th street, approaching predominantly white torrance, the white  population jumps even higher, to 66.3%, while the asian population dips to 8.6%  and the number of blacks rises slightly, to 2%. median household income is  27,607.  although it is primarily residential, the gateway also includes a burgeoning  business district at the san diego and harbor freeways, where, according to the  california department of transportation, 500,000 cars drive by each day, making  it the second-busiest intersection in southern california.  the so-called 190th street corridor is a major drawing card for commercial  developers, who have built about 5 million square feet of office space there in  the last eight years. gleaming high-rises with pleasant landscaping have  replaced a shell oil refinery and manufacturing plants.  \"we sort of had a shift from the industrial age to the information age,\" said  howard mann, president of andrex development co., one of the area\\'s major  developers.  mann predicts that the move away from industrial to commercial uses will help  upgrade nearby areas by attracting home buyers who hold high-paying jobs in  what he calls harbor gateway\\'s \"urban cluster.\" already, he is planning a  restaurant to meet that market, based on an analysis that, he said, \"found that  the average income per household within a 5-mile radius of this intersection is  50,000.\"  dining in elegance, however, is certainly not a priority farther north in  harbor gateway, where large concentrations of undocumented latinos residents  are struggling to get by.  a study by the united way found that illegal latino immigrants are the \"most  under-served\" group in the gateway.  haddon and other local leaders said their presence also makes it difficult to  form neighborhood coalitions because illegal aliens fear they will attract  unwanted attention from immigration authorities if they participate in  community affairs.  \"their need is to be invisible,\" the minister said, \"and that does not make for  a good community.\"  haddon is particularly attuned to the problems of undocumented residents  because his church runs the 3-year-old harbor gateway center, one of only two  social service agencies the united way found serving the strip.  center\\'s problems  the center -- which offers a variety of nutritional, health and educational  programs to about 1,500 people -- lacks money and staff. the executive director  left more than a year ago when the money to pay her ran out. haddon, who took  the pastor\\'s job in july, has been doing her job ever since.  united way officials say they would like to strengthen the center and also  persuade social service agencies in neighboring communities to expand  operations here. their study showed that the area lacks adequate shelters for  battered women, delinquency prevention programs, drug- and alcohol-abuse  programs and crisis intervention centers.  if there is one common thread in the complaints from gateway residents, it is  the increasing gang activity and the lack of police protection. many said that  they go for days without seeing a patrol car and that officers covering the  area are often sent on calls elsewhere.  los angeles police officials said they have been trying to improve service,  especially during the past year when citizens groups and flores have pressed  for additional patrols. but they also acknowledged that cars are called out of  the area more often than they would like. capt. sandy wasson of the los angeles  police department\\'s southeast division, which covers the part of the strip  north of the san diego freeway, took issue with residents who say harbor  gateway gets less than its fair share of coverage. he said a recent deployment  study showed that while the area has fewer patrol cars -- just one basic car in  the north and one in the south -- it also has less crime.  wasson said he views harbor gateway as \"a neighborhood in transition that\\'s got  great potential.\" he has encouraged the formation of neighborhood watch groups.  flores, for one, said she senses a growing participation in such groups and \"a  renewed interest in community improvement.\"  she maintained that the city has improved services in recent years, especially  police coverage. she also noted that a harbor gateway paramedic unit was  established in june and that this year, the city library department finally  included a proposal for a harbor gateway branch in its long-term plan.  the councilwoman said she would like the gateway to have its own post office  and zip code.  \"i think it\\'s important,\" she said, \"to have an actual tag and title on who you  are and where you are.\"  but she said she knows persuading the federal government will be difficult.  in the meantime, flores said, she is thankful for whatever recognition the new  name has brought the area.  \"at least,\" she said, \"i know that when i mention harbor gateway in city  council now, my colleagues know what i\\'m talking about.\"  ',\n",

       "  'text': 'two young men were killed and four people wounded as drive-by gunmen and street  gangs marked the beginning of the long holiday weekend with a series of  shootings, ending 1988 with record mayhem.  the weekend\\'s first fatal shooting occurred at 9 p.m. friday in south los  angeles, where raymond smith, 21, was shot and killed, apparently by occupants  of a passing car, as he stood in the 200 block of west 84th street, lt. bob  hansohn said. nearby, 20 minutes later, adam lopez, 16, was shot to death from  a passing car as he walked out of a liquor store at 54th and hoover streets.  the two shootings were not believed to be related. hansohn, of the 77th street  division, said no suspects had been taken into custody but the shootings \"would  probably turn out to be\" gang-related.  three other shootings, all in an area west of downtown, were apparently  retaliatory attacks involving two rival gangs, sgt. ray heslop of the rampart  division said saturday. those shootings left four people wounded, two of them  critically.  heslop said edward moran, 21, of tujunga, was driving past a group of men  gathered on a front porch on witmer street between 3rd and 6th streets at 11:30  p.m. friday, when they yelled out gang slogans and fired three shots, heslop  said. moran was hit once in the leg.  nearby, ramon gomez, 24, was standing at the corner of temple street and  edgeware road at 1 a.m. saturday when two men drove past in a car and fired  three shots from a small caliber revolver, heslop said. he was wounded in the  knee.  heslop said the shooting \"was apparently\" by the same gang members who had  fired at moran from the sidewalk and who had gotten into a car to continue the  gunplay.  a third shooting, possibly related to the first two, occurred at 2:30 a.m. near  crown hill street and loma drive when several shots were fired from an unknown  source into a group of young men and women, critically wounding a man in the  arm and back, and a woman in the chest and back, heslop said.  both victims were taken to the county-usc medical center. their names were not  released.  the killings in the 77th street division were not included in either the  sheriff\\'s or police department\\'s preliminary statistics, which indicated 1988  would end with record totals of gang violence.  the police department reported 207 gang killings in the first 10 months of the  year, a 24.7% jump over the 166 in the same period of 1987.  the sheriff\\'s department, which patrols unincorporated areas of los angeles  county and contracts its services to smaller cities, reported 94 gang killings  in 1988, an 18.1% increase over 1987.  although police statistics were available only through october, the sheriff\\'s  report, issued friday, backed up statements by sheriff sherman block that gang  violence was on a dramatic rise.

       "  'text': 'there are years when a look back over the year\\'s most significant films for  that arbitrary ten comes with what one writer once called that nasty ratcheting  sound made by scraping the bottom of the barrel. then there are years when each  move to pare down to only 10 brings hours of remorse and deliberation.  and oddly enough, this was one of those killer years. as it warmed up, 1988 may  not have seemed fated to be an extra superbly choicest year, if you could grade  movies the way they grade tea. but it gained momentum after a slow first half  until finally the year could be chalked up as fat, full and innovative.  you cannot fault innovation, not in the same calendar year that marked \"who  framed roger rabbit\" and \"little dorrit,\" but full is certainly a big part of  that equation. between new screens cropping up like mushrooms after a rain and  the insatiable maw of video, which insists that movies at least curtsy on a big  screen before being gulped down into the small one, we are seeing roughly 60  more films now than we did in 1982.  when you are staring, dumbfounded, at the marshamallowed dimensions of a film  like \"zelly and me\" it can seem a particularly high psychic price to pay,  simply to fill more theater screens. particularly when some of the theaters are  roughly the size of an airline washroom, and flood with light whenever  late-comers shuffle into to one of their 45 seats.  then a film like \"the chocolate war\" gets its crack at one of those screens,  giving audiences a chance to discover the strengths of its astonishingly  assured young debuting director, keith gordon, and it all seems worth it again.  1988 may be remembered as the point at which the quintessentially american  movie came back into its own, giving us the outright delights of \"punchline,\"  \"bull durham,\" \"big,\" \"8 men out,\" \"roger rabbit,\" \"dominick and eugene,\"  \"tucker\" or \" working girl.\"  it was also the year for films adapted from exceptionally knotty books, and  succeed or fail, the determination involved in \"the unbearable lightness of  being,\" \"the accidental tourist,\" \"little dorrit,\" \"the milagro beanfield war,\"  \"pelle the conqueror\" and \"the last temptation of christ\" had to be admired.  art, music and even food had their day on the screen with \"the moderns,\"  \"vincent,\" \"bird\" \"long live the lady\" and \"babette\\'s feast.\" by and large,  films with urgent social or political issues still came with passports or not  at all: \"a world apart,\" \"hotel terminus: the life and times of klaus barbie,\"  \"a cry in the dark,\" \"salaam bombay!\" in some cases it was a foreign-born  director who took on american social issues, the case of \"betrayed\" and  \"mississippi burning.\"  the 10 films that impressed me most this year are below, ranked in order, with  special notice that \"punchline\" very nearly threw the whole matter into a tie.  so, the runner up-list is a hair\\'s breath one this year.  1. \"it\\'s not just how much you love someone,\" william hurt as a grieving father  muses in \"the accidental tourist,\" \"it\\'s who you are when you\\'re with them.\"  director-co-writer lawrence kasdan has made watching this man come alive,  perhaps for the first time, into a small-scale epiphany. what\\'s startling is  how this story, which takes place during hurt\\'s second year of mourning, can be  as funny as it is. however, like anne tyler\\'s singular book, the humor comes  from character and the family hurt springs from is memorable enough to have  escaped from dickens. among the excellent ensemble, all of whom seem to have a  decidedly droll bent and a knack for underplaying, you can find the  irresistible geena davis. she plays a dog obedience trainer to whom hurt\\'s  welsh corgi, edward, takes an enormous shine. it\\'s entirely understandable.  2. \"little dorrit\\'s\" virtues are not simply its off-handed display of the cream  of british actors: derek jacobi, alec guinness, miriam margolyes, roshan seth,  joan greenwood, eleanor bron, cyril cusack, but the toughness and  accomplishment with which director christine edzard\\'s adaptation makes dickens  as pertinent as this week\\'s stock-fixing headlines.  the qualities which made george bernard shaw call the novel \"more seditious  than \"das kapital\" are here in abundance and edzard asks that we see the story  in two films, six hours in all however her method is not epic but intimate. by  the time we have come to dorrit\\'s triumphant conclusion, the faces, and voices  of london at that time, the working poor as well as the drawling rich, have  been stamped upon us forever.  3. \"a cry in the dark\" is an angry film, an outraged one really, as director  fred schepisi lays out the almost unbelieveable path of australian  jurisprudence and/or media hijinks by which a bereft mother became, in the eyes  of the public, the ritual killer of her own infant daughter.  its power comes from schepisi\\'s blend of passion and detachment and from the  best performance meryl streep has given so far. (do we seem to write this each  year? if so, it\\'s true -- this is a talent you can watch deepen and become  further refined with each role.) streep has a perfectly matched thoroughbred  opposite her in sam neill he makes this seventh day adventist pastor\\'s fall  from smugness and self-assurance a wracking business.  4. \"salaam, bombay!\" throws us into the life of bombay\\'s street kids with an  ebullience and an energy that\\'s matched exactly by the film\\'s tough-mindedness.  director mira nair asks for no pity for her urchins and she doesn\\'t romanticize  them either, but there is no way you cannot be haunted by them. \"salaam  bombay!\" is not nair\\'s first film about exploitation as a way of life in  india\\'s cities, but it is her first non-documentary and she brings to her work  a wonderful eye and a truly cinematic flair for story telling. as you leave  10-year old krishna, you may be reminded of \"the 400 blows,\" sacrilegious as  that may sound. but \"salaam bombay!\" didn\\'t win nair the camera d\\'or at cannes  in 1988, for best new director, for nothing.  5. in a year of largely literal films, the poetry of wim wenders\\' \"wings of  desire\" soars, on the wings of his two berliner angels, with peter handke\\'s  screenplay and with the camera of henri alekan, who might be considered  something of an expert on black and white fairy tales, since it was he who also  photographed \"beauty and the beast.\" peter falk gives the film a wry, gutsy  center, but its essence is its passionate declaration of the need for trust,  love and commitment a cheerfully anachronistic, contagiously optimistic tack.  6. in a way, austrian director percy adlon was working on the same wavelength  in \"bagdad cafe\" that wenders was in \"wings of desire,\" although adlon was  playing a little more with the elements of personal discovery. those qualities  make \"bagdad cafe\" a slow-burning fuse, whose charm grows on you like its great  and haunting song, \"i\\'m calling you.\"  its story of two heartily unalike women, the american cch pounder, the bavarian  marianne sagebrecht, who meet and join forces against a largely disinterested  world in the california desert, depends largely on the charm of ex-cabaret  artist sagebrecht and long-time theater actress pounder. both of them are  exceptional, but sagebrecht carries a special something extra, as anyone who  saw her in \"sugarbaby\" will remember.  7. ostensibly about a \"failed\" car manufacturer, \"tucker,\" is francis ford  coppola\\'s tribute to america\\'s loners, its dreamers, whether they make  ballpoint pens, or vast unflyable airplanes like the film\\'s enigma, howard  hughes. (or, by the smallest stretch, if they make roundly disliked movies.)  loose-limbed and innovative, fueled by a full-throttle performance by jeff  bridges as tucker, it\\'s a film that could have used more of the darker tones of  tucker\\'s life -- heaven knows there were enough of them. but scenes like the  launching of \"the car of tomorrow, today\" or the mysterioso meeting between  tucker and dean stockwell\\'s howard hughes do a lot toward shutting down minor  complaints.  8. the beauty and control david cronenberg uses to tell his melancholy, macabre  tale of symbiotic twin doctors in \"dead ringers\" shows the director at a new  high of maturity, and jeremy irons\\' dual portrayal as one bordering on the  eerie. dealing, again, with the body, its mysteries and its final frightening  independence from what we would have it do, \"dead ringers\"\\' twins are loosely  based on a real manhattan pair, but they are more plainly metaphors for any  relationship that begins in love and ends in pathology. to think of a film this  assured, this unified and this dizzyingly potent, you have to go back to \"blue  velvet.\"  9. \"red sorghum\" makes you suspect that its director, 37-year old zhang yimou,  was cinema-doomed from the cradle: his saga, which ends during the japanese  invasion of china, is part folk-tale, part love story and completely thrilling  to behold. to credit this as zhang\\'s directorial debut is not to tell the whole  story: before this he has also been a masterly cinematographer (\"yellow earth,\"  \"the big parade) and an actor whose performance in \"the old well\" won him first  prize at tokyo\\'s film festival. it\\'s especially interesting to see a film from  modern china with the scale and sensibilities about nature of the kurosawa of  \"dersu uzala.\"  10. after you see \"a world apart\" you realize that the great film about south  africa is still waiting to be made. however, this personal one, the homage by a  daughter to her martyred mother -- the first white woman jailed under south  africa\\'s 90-day detention law -- as empathetically directed by chris menges, is  a firm step in that direction. three memorably fine performances came out of  this: barbara hershey and young jodhi may as mother and daughter linda mvusi  as their housekeeper. if somehow the facts of existence in south africa had  escaped you, \" a world apart\" might be the perfect place to start.  those hotly close runners-up are \"punchline,\" \"the moderns,\" \"babette\\'s feast,\"  \"8 men out,\" \"women on the verge of a nervous breakdown,\" \"last temptation of  christ,\" \"hotel terminus: the life and times of klaus barbie,\" \"track 29,\"  \"vincent\" and \"who framed roger rabbit.\"  sheila benson\\'s top ten  1. \"the accidental tourist\"  2. \"little dorrit\"  3. \"a cry in the dark\"  4. \"salaam bombay!\"  5. \"wings of desire\"  6. \"bagdad cafe\"  7. \"tucker\"  8. \"dead ringers\"  9. \"red sorghum\"  10. \"a world apart\"  ',\n",

       "  'text': 'a surprising amount of good work got done in los angeles theater in 1988,  considering that it was a war year.  for months, actors\\' equity and the smaller theaters fought out the question of  how to compensate waiver actors. this at least established the principle that  waiver actors deserved compensation. but it also used up a lot of energy. by  year\\'s end, you had to hope that the waiver wars were winding down: everybody  was sick of them.  meanwhile, the smaller theaters got on with it. a fine young writer named jamie  baker had a double debut. his \"don\\'t go back to rockville\" was first seen at  the pacific theatre ensemble, then at the victory theatre. set in 1944, it  concerned a surly young kentucky derby jockey named ed (andrew philpot). his  unaffectionate progeny turned up a few months later at the tamarind theater in  baker\\'s \"south central rain.\"  ed and his nasty-nice spawn didn\\'t have a lot to recommend them as human  beings, but they had a sneaky vitality as stage characters. they suggested  lanford wilson\\'s talley clan, except that they didn\\'t come off as \"characters,\"  but as people with real needs -- even if selfish ones. volume three of this  family saga is awaited with interest.  rafael lima also hit the mark with \"el salvador\" at the gnu theatre. the scene  here was a hotel room from which a group of journalists were trying to cover  the war in el salvador without getting their heads shot off, and the message  was that this kind of life can get to be addictive. an oddly effective  combination of \"the front page\" and \"apocalypse now,\" tautly directed by the  gnu\\'s jeff seymour.  it was an election year, and the bush-dukakis debates provided playacting of a  dim sort. but there weren\\'t many overtly political plays. jeff goldsmith\\'s  \"mccarthy\" at the odyssey came closest, a somewhat overwritten script, but with  two lean and mean performances: victor brandt as tail gunner joe and ralph  seymour as roy cohn.  aids remained a scourge. \"jerker\" -- the notorious script by robert chesley  that the fcc had found pornographic when it was performed on kpfk -- got a live  production at the fifth estate theatre. it ended with a tired voice saying,  over a judy garland record, that he couldn\\'t come to the phone right now but  please leave a message. no more needed to be said.  in larger theaters, the best work, and certainly the most work, was done by the  los angeles theatre center. not everything that latc attempted came off, but  each of its shows had a reason for being and left a sense that somebody at the  theater was in its corner.  latc introduced us to two playwrights with imagination and control, jose rivera  and marlane meyer. rivera was born in puetro rico, and his \"the promise\" was a  wild juxtaposition of family drama and tall tale, set in a world as real as a  rusty muffler, yet a world where demons came and went. marlane meyer gave us  two plays, \"etta jenks\" and \"kingfish.\" the first brought back to life the  cliche of the girl who goes to the dogs when she tries to break into the  movies. meyer\\'s script worked because it dealt with the grungy hollywood that  actually exists, as opposed to the oz of popular imagination and because meyer  didn\\'t waste any time sentimentalizing over etta. (actress deirdre o\\'connell  didn\\'t sentimentalize her, either.)  \"kingfish\" concerned a non-existent dog who nonetheless existed, since it was  to the interest of certain parties that he do so. this could have been a  terribly precious play. perhaps the conceptual framework imposed on it by  director david schweizer was a bit precious. but, again, meyer knew her people.  she knew, for instance, that a lonely bachelor (buck henry) might covet a son  (merritt butrick) so badly that he would pay to have one. this script didn\\'t go  any farther out than human behavior does. we\\'re just not used to seeing it go  this far in the theater.  latc also took on the russians. stein winge\\'s nightmarish production of \"the  inspector general\" got all tangled up in its bedclothes, but ron campbell  proved wonderfully idiotic in the lead. charles marowitz\\'s staging of \"the sea  gull\" was dead-on: a production that called chekhov\\'s characters to account,  rather than issuing them a blanket pardon because they were all so sensitive.  bill bushnell\\'s staging of alexander galin\\'s \"stars in the morning sky\" didn\\'t  redeem a pedestrian script about some played-out whores in \"protective custody\"  during the 1980 moscow olympics. nevertheless, as with \"sarcophagus\" in \\'87,  the play was an interesting theater event -- further proof that soviet  playwrights no longer have to pretend that they live in utopia.  this was the pattern at latc last year: even when the play fell short, the  viewer could grab onto something. another example: chloe webb\\'s exuberant  performance as the schizophrenic daughter in \"the model apartment.\" latc is on  a roll these days: you can feel the energy in the lobby.  the only time you felt that energy in the mark taper forum lobby in \\'88 was  after \"the colored museum.\" younger viewers, black and white, had been  exhilarated by the anger in george c. wolfe\\'s script, while older people  suspected that wolfe was reviving the hurtful black stereotypes of the past,  under the guise of satirizing them.  few other taper plays proved so stimulating: certainly not its yuppified  production of george walker\\'s \"nothing sacred.\" it was good to see joe chaikin  back at taper, too. director robert woodruff kept sam shepard\\'s loose-jointed  \"a lie of the mind\" all in one piece. ron taylor gave a tremendous supporting  performance in  \"lost highway.\" but it was a season that said \"me, too\" rather than, as in the  old days at the taper, \"look at this!\" or are we romanticizing the old days?  \"fences\" was the doolittle\\'s big hit, with james earl jones even more resonant  than he had been on broadway, and lynne thigpen taking no garbage as his wife.  another august wilson play, \"joe turner\\'s come and gone,\" played the old globe  theatre prior to broadway, with delroy lindo as a self-flaying fugitive.  the pasadena playhouse, once given up for dead, had a fine year. amanda mcbroom  starred in the splendid \"lies and legends,\" based on harry chapin\\'s songs. the  show later transferred to beverly hills. we can\\'t understand why robert  harling\\'s beauty-parlor comedy \"steel magnolias\" didn\\'t make a similar  transfer. barbara rush and the rest of the cast loved doing it, the audience  loved watching it, and even a critic had to acknowledge that behind the sitcom  rhythms, there was a genuine admiration here for the way women can get it  together.  as opposed to men. jules feiffer\\'s \"carnal knowledge\" at the playhouse had  gregory harrison and david marshall grant as two guys who treat women like the  enemy, and end up sandbagging themselves. this was also the predicament of sean  penn, danny aiello and the other scuzzy hollywood guys in \"hurlyburly,\" staged  by playwright david rabe at the westwood playhouse.  disgracefully, the \"hurlyburly\" company canceled a performance just before  curtain-time, the excuse being that their friend gary busey had just had a  motorcycle accident. the professional reaction, in this circumstance, is to  dedicate the performance to your friend and go on. nonetheless, penn and his  colleagues -- including mare winningham as the toughest of their lady friends  -- gave \"hurlyburly\" one hell of a ride.  the funniest classical revival of the year was south coast repertory\\'s \"school  for scandal,\" which director paul marcus set in a strange land where  18th-century types read the national enquirer. scr also brought us an urgent  revival of \"the crucible,\" directed by martin benson -- one of those shows  where the audience gasps even when it knows what\\'s coming next. in san diego,  the show of the year was the san diego repertory theatre\\'s \"red noses,\" peter  barnes\\' black comedy about the uses of comedy in a bad time. co-produced with  the dell\\'arte players of blue lake, calif., the production combined expert  clowning and scathing satire. only one show gave us more pure pleasure during  1988 -- the moscow circus.

       "  'text': 'everybody hooted last january when texas record producer (and legendary  self-promoter) major bill smith concocted an elvis presley birthday tribute,  \"hey! big e. happy 53!,\" claiming the king had faked his death so he could live  in anonymity.  but major bill had the last laugh. in a year when brian wilson, patti smith and  jimmy page\\'s comebacks flopped, elvis had the biggest revival of all, making  tabloid headlines, starring in priscilla\\'s best-seller and being celebrated in  a musical about his life.  by the end of the year, you got the feeling elvis was on tour again -- popping  up at burger kings in kalamazoo, car washes in georgia and the parking lot of a  las vegas hotel. in august, wcvg in cincinnati switched to an all-elvis format.  in september, cheap trick\\'s \"don\\'t be cruel\" became the first elvis re-make to  go top 10. in november, priscilla and lisa marie did an olds ad. in december,  an l.a. elvis impersonator announced plans to turn his san fernando valley home  into a mock graceland.  even without elvis, 1988 was a banner year for pop follies. so let\\'s celebrate  the music world\\'s clown princes in our yearly round-up of dubious achievements,  inglorious moments and show-biz scams.  presenter of the year: beach boy mike love, who livened up the 1988 rock and  roll hall of fame awards by noisily blasting mick jagger: \"we did 180  performances last year. . . . i\\'d like to see mick jagger get on stage and do  \\'i get around\\' rather than \\'jumpin\\' jack flash.\\' mick\\'s always been chicken to  get on stage with the beach boys.\"  jail sentence: to the yugoslav folk singer who was sentenced to 60 days in jail  and fined 80 for refusing to sing \"comrade tito, we pledge to you that we will  not swerve from your path,\" an official state song glorifying marshal tito,  founder of the country\\'s communist party.  prince fan: richard nixon, who titled his latest political tract \"1999.\"  national anthem performance: saxophonist kenny g, whose anthem rendition at the  sixth game of the national league playoffs here was blasted as \"unbelievably  terrible\" by dodger second baseman steve sax. \"i can\\'t believe it. it was the  worst i ever heard. i could have played it better than he did,\" said sax, who  was so upset that he shook his fist at g while walking back to the dugout.  dodger right fielder mike marshall added: \"it was a disgrace to america.\"  quote, part 1: debbie gibson: \"on halloween, i had a party where we had a  seance. we tried to contact liberace and sid vicious.\"  drug bust: reporting that soul legend james brown was charged for possession of  the hallucinogenic drug pcp after a car chase through two states this fall,  rolling stone quoted a georgia highway patrolman who said that when arrested,  brown \"started singing \\'georgia\\' and was doing his \\'good foot\\' dance when we  gave him the sobriety test.\"  grammy acceptance speech: best female country vocal performance winner k.t.  oslin, who told the press: \"i\\'m so excited that i feel like i\\'m going to throw  up any minute now.\"  public address announcer: paul strelzin, announcer for the texas league\\'s el  paso diablos, was ejected from a game against the jackson mets after  infuriating umpires by repeatedly playing the verse \"i\\'ve been cheated, been  mistreated\" from linda ronstadt\\'s \"when will i be loved\" after a series of  close calls at first base.  backstage stiff: when ex-ollie north secretary fawn hall asked to meet bruce  springsteen backstage at his washington concert, she received a note saying: \"i  didn\\'t think much of ollie north, so why should i want to meet his secretary?\"  quote, part 2: terence trent d\\'arby: \"i\\'ve had three lives: the first time i  was an ethiopian pirate around 600 bc. then i was an 18th-century painter. the  last time i was a very talented but unsuccessful country and western singer.\"  ramones fan: celebrated manhattan preppie-killer robert chambers. he donned a  shoulder-length wig and imitated ramones leader joey ramone singing \"rockaway  beach\" on a videotape that an ex-girlfriend sold to a local new york tv  station, which aired the clip earlier this year.  subpoena: when contestants in a lawsuit involving former mca artist donnie iris  couldn\\'t persuade mca records chairman irving azoff to testify in a lawsuit  hearing, they served the industry mogul with a subpoena at the forum during  half time of a lakers-spurs playoff game.  deejay: after the baltimore orioles lost 10 straight games, baltimore morning  deejay bob rivers swore he would stay locked in his wiyy-fm studio until the  team won a game. he ended up stuck on the air for 258 straight hours until the  team ended its record 21-game losing streak last april.  worst band name: johnny hates jazz.  moll: dolly parton, who totes a gun -- legally -- and said she pulled it out of  her purse when accosted by a man when she was walking in new york this summer.  \"i pointed it at him and told him if he didn\\'t take a hike, i\\'d turn him into a  soprano.\"  led zeppelin fan: spago impresario wolfgang puck, who apparently forgot that  jimmy page was the band\\'s guitar hero. when ex-zeppelin singer robert plant was  in town for a summer concert appearance, puck presented him with a  guitar-shaped pizza.  quote, part 3: washington wife crusader tipper gore: \"i love rock \\'n\\' roll. i  was one of the earliest springsteen fans. i played drums in high school. you\\'re  talking to someone who really understands rock music.\"  exclusive interview: during last year\\'s february sweeps, kabc-tv ballyhooed a  chat with ex-beatle george harrison as an \"exclusive\" interview -- even though  harrison complained throughout the story about \"all these interviews\" he had  been doing.  manager: doc mcghee, whose management firm handles such pop superstars as bon  jovi and motley crue, pleaded guilty last january to importing 40,000 pounds of  marijuana, worth 9 million, into the united states. the indictment came weeks  after mcghee and partner doug thaler were named personal managers of the year  in pollstar magazine\\'s readers poll awards.  overstatement: when the american cinematheque screened the rarely seen sex  pistols documentary, \"the great rock \\'n\\' roll swindle\" in january, festival  organizers ballyhooed the showing as \"the last u.s. screening ever.\" this came  as a surprise to julien temple, the film\\'s director, who quipped: \"what are  they going to do -- burn it?\"  fragrance: john lennon\\'s first wife, cynthia, took advantage of the hoopla  surrounding her late husband by launching a new fragrance, woman perfume. the  fragrance was named after the song \"woman,\" from lennon\\'s \"double fantasy\"  album, even though the ballad was written for yoko ono, the woman lennon left  cynthia to marry.  reunion: when the stray cats held a press conference in august to herald the  band getting back together after a four-year layoff, the group somehow  neglected to mention that they had recorded a reunion album two years ago --  which stiffed.  magazine issue: spin magazine\\'s november issue, which contained a free condom  in each copy as a symbol of the editors\\' support for safe sex practices.

       "  'text': 'if your great-aunt\\'s bridge club donned leather cycle duds and power-chorded  its way through songs about life in the gutter, it\\'d probably stand a good  chance of getting a record deal.  at least that\\'s the way it seems, considering the hard-rock feeding frenzy on  the part of record companies in the wake of guns n\\' roses\\' multi-platinum  breakthrough. and with geffen having snapped up such promising bands as little  caesar and junkyard, there\\'s no reason to think that frenzy won\\'t continue well  into 1989.  not that the continually healthy street-metal crowd had much competition this  year:  the best thing you could say about the rest of the l.a. rock scene in 1988 was  that nothing really coalesced into any kind of movement that would be easy for  trendoids and sycophants to glom onto, meaning that many worthy acts around  town were free to develop on their own and not worry about fitting into a  \"scene.\"  on the other hand, the worst thing about the l.a. rock scene in 1988 was that  nothing new really coalesced into any kind of movement that would produce an  irresistible buzz, meaning that many worthy acts around town didn\\'t get the  attention they deserved.  after all, what does it say about the vitality of the local club circuit when  one of the brightest pop hopes to emerge from l.a. in 1988 -- melissa etheridge  -- determined that playing the clubs was a waste of time and elected to build  her career through playing beach community taverns?  and who would have thought that the local independent act to get the most media  attention would be ailee willis \"discoverees,\" the del rubio triplets, three  middle-aged sisters who apply their harmonies to the likes of \"walk like an  egyptian\" and willis\\' \"neutron dance,\" and make most of their concert  appearances at nursing and retirement homes?  there are, though, two promising trends that began to emerge in \\'88: nu folk  (the name\\'s gotta go) and the latest edition of l.a. psychedelia.  such clubs as bogart\\'s, club lingerie and the music machine suddenly swung open  their doors to acoustic troubadours, while new clubs like the breakaway and the  gaslight were created specifically for that low-key approach. (the revived ash  grove couldn\\'t make it, though.)  nu names to watch: meaning-seeker mark davis and witty social observer milo  binder seem the most likely to make a mark, while bands different world and the  beef sisters could develop into contenders as well.  among the murky mind-expansion brigade, jane\\'s addiction is certainly the most  prominent, while fellow late-night denizen caterwaul also seems a good  candidate for big things, based on the preview ep i.r.s. has just issued. an  album from the betsy martin-fronted quartet is due early this year. the stable  of psyche-rock purveyors at nate starkman &amp son records also seems quite  promising, with shiva burlesque, the best of the bunch, reportedly getting some  major label attention these days.  the best live club act this year was mary\\'s danish, which combines the droll  wit and delivery of singers julie ritter and gretchen seager with a wild, loose  funk-rock sound. american martyrs and the bel-fires have also both developed  strong live presences that seem ripe for big-label vinyl.  the wild cards, who released a debut lp \"cool not cold,\" also could (finally)  be the band to follow fellow latinos los lobos to national attention. and the  country world offers potential matinee idol jim lauderdale (a debut album  coming soon from epic), country-rock songstresses lucinda williams (a new album  that more than lives up to her good name around local clubs) and kimm rogers.

       "  'text': 'well, it\\'s over again. bits of pastel serpentine weave through the carpet and a  champagne cork is wedged into the potted palm. time to stare out at the garden  and ruminate on \\'88.  it might have gone down as the year when the tainted opulence of post-modernism  was in full flower, the spectacle of an art world where aesthetics are swamped  by jillionaire collectors flourishing power.  winter: armand hammer announced he would jerk his blue-chip collection away  from the los angeles county museum of art where it had been promised repeatedly  for nearly 20 years. hammer decided to establish his own private boutique  museum in westwood.  spring: negotiations aimed at bringing norton simon\\'s fabled collections under  the stewardship of ucla guttered out.  summer: the annual confrontation between the j. paul getty museum and thomas  hoving\\'s connoisseur magazine arrived with the predictability of the gas bill.  the getty bought a rare ancient greek aphrodite and hoving said it had been  smuggled out of italy. something similar had happened the year before. and the  year before that.  fall: new york auctions turned into a feeding frenzy that drove prices for  modern art to stratospheric obscenity. a jasper johns brought 17 million. a  picasso at 24.75 million, then another in london for 38.5 million. sales  totals in the hundreds of millions.  felt like the last days of pompeii, lavish hysteria.  remember when great art was called \"priceless\"? there was something nice about  that. \"priceless\" said it doesn\\'t matter if a work of art sells for 50 or 50  million, the experience of it is about something else, something delicate,  numinous and poetic. hard figures vulgarize the expression like a price tag put  on the act of love.  it could have been remembered as a year of fascinating naughty titivating  tattle out of \"life styles of the rich and arrogant\" but things happened in los  angeles that evidence significance. a generation of artists who were once art\\'s  quirky young turks came to mature fulfillment.  this gratifying harvest was probably best symbolized by a man who is not a  painter or a sculptor but an architect. frank gehry has long been the l.a. art  world\\'s architect -- openly and deeply influenced by everybody from billy al  bengston to robert irwin. his year began with a traveling retrospective at the  museum of contemporary art. it was a triumph of exhibition design including  recreations of copper-clad spiral rooms, a walk-in fish used as an office by  somebody with jonah-in-the-whale fantasies, cardboard tables and chairs that  looked like bats wearing bearskin coats, all wonderfully imaginative and gently  tough.  the next thing you knew, gehry was the centerpiece of a new york exhibition  god-fathered by philip johnson. titled \"deconstructivist architecture,\" it  placed gehry at the wellspring position among an international group searching  for ways to revivify the modernist structural vocabulary.  by year\\'s end, architectural critics had praised him as the most important  practitioner in the country. he became a rare prophet in his own land when he  finally received a commission for a key cultural building, the disney pavilion  at the music center.  no discouraging word was heard around gehry\\'s apotheosis. clearly deserved, it  was nothing but justice done.  the rest of the year was punctuated with echoes of the l.a. aesthetic coming to  mature ripening. david hockney\\'s retrospective at lacma found the transplanted  brit intelligent, urbane, witty and curious. this artist, who virtually created  l.a.\\'s own hedonistic image of itself -- reflected in the whiplash ripples of  its pools -- left us a lot to ponder. hockney -- sometimes seen as a  lightweight who fritters away his gifts on opera sets and polaroid montages --  can no more be denied the underlying seriousness of his purpose than could noel  coward.  as the months rolled by, the sense of l.a. coming into its own just kept on  blossoming. there were external events such as the opening of lacma\\'s pavilion  for japanese art. housing joe d. price\\'s superb collection of edo period  painting in an imaginative and apt building by the late bruce goff provided a  curiously exotic harmonic to lacma\\'s diverse architectural styles. curator  stephanie barron confirmed her expertise and originality in the exhibition  \"german expressionism, the second generation.\"  but artists -- l.a. artists -- managed to hold center stage. bengston\\'s  retrospective, still on view at lacma, added itself to hockney, and a look back  at richard diebenkorn\\'s works on paper headed this way in march from new york.  there is an unexpected overlap in their work, in its shared tropical pastel  palette and fundamental concern with timeless questions of drawing and  composition. they share a degree of calm mastery.  count in the sculptor robert graham, whose lacma showing of his monument to  duke ellington found him more flexible and more calmly assured than ever.  but it was old ed moses who came sidewinding out of the chute like a buckaroo  on a stoned pony. paintings seen at l.a. louver certainly constituted the  commercial gallery show of the year, with their crazy pollock-ribbons of paint  kicking open deep space with all the control of a frank stella. if a full-dress  moses retrospective is not in the works, there just ain\\'t no justice.  and it was not just the boys who came up smiling. l.a.\\'s enduring maverick\\'s  maverick joyce treiman was reviewed in a usc exhibition. her classic painterly  realist diary of haunted art fantasies and spiritual insight revealed new  depths to even her closest observers.  and lacma tipped our hat to helen lundeberg, who was painting around here when  our ranking patriarchs were still on tricycles.  it left us all knowing that making real art takes a long time. this amazing  payoff represents at least three decades of artistic ripening. it was all begun  when things were very focused around here. people who paid attention knew all  the artists who counted and followed their work in great detail. the people who  made the work had anybody\\'s normal dreams of recognition and reward, but they  were going to make their art if it meant two-bit second jobs and a lifetime of  spaghetti and cheap red wine.  in today\\'s sprawling, overpopulated, fast-buck climate, where good artists cave  in to making corporate decoration and careers blaze and fizzle like flat-tire  flares, it\\'s hard to know where a comparable generation is going to come from  in 2025. art goes on. that there is still serious purpose out there somewhere  was well attested by the anselm kiefer survey at moca. there\\'s always hope, but  the future has a formidable task of sorting ahead.  funny how nice stuff manages to happen in a climate where every charge of  vulgarized art and popularized museums is absolutely true. and yet they keep  managing to engage us deeply with revelatory revivals, such as lacma\\'s current  guido reni exhibitions, or with once-in-a-lifetime extravaganzas, such as the  metropolitan\\'s degas exhibition or the pageant of paul gauguin at the national  gallery.  proves there are still good people out there doing the right thing. proves that  no matter how fetid the climate, art is still great stuff.

       "  'text': 'in a surprise move, the outgoing president of venezuela said saturday that the  fourth-biggest debtor in latin america is suspending principal payments on  nearly all of its 30.3-billion debt to foreign banks.  the move was not as drastic a step as halting interest payments, but it  highlights a hardening of attitudes among latin american leaders over the  worsening economic situation.  enormous toll reflected  venezuela, a leading oil exporter, has been a model debtor nation and was the  only big latin american debtor to continue making principal payments through  the 1980s. but the decision saturday reflects the enormous toll being taken on  latin american countries by huge debt payments to foreign banks.  the debt crisis, which is entering its seventh year, has choked off growth in  many latin american economies as earnings are devoted to paying foreign debt  instead of financing local growth. latin american leaders have warned that  declining living standards threaten the region\\'s political stability and its  fledgling democratic governments.  president-elect george bush said in december that he will order a major review  of current u.s. strategy for dealing with third world debt. he told reporters  that \"we\\'ve got enormous problems, particularly in our own hemisphere, with  third world debt.\"  in a nationwide television address announcing the venezuelan suspension of  payments, president jaime lusinchi said, \"the problem of foreign debt today  strangles the economic and social development of the great majority of the  world\\'s peoples.\"  oil revenue slump  he said he had ordered the suspension, effective jan. 17, because of the slump  in revenue from oil exports and what he said were high interest rates on the  debt. lusinchi said that venezuelan officials plan to meet soon with their  leading creditor banks to negotiate new terms on the loans.  a u.s. banker familiar with venezuela\\'s position said the country wants to  reduce its loan payments by stretching out the terms of its existing loans.  between 35% and 40% of the 30.3 billion is owed to u.s. banks. chase manhattan  bank in new york is venezuela\\'s leading u.s. lender. san francisco-based bank  of america is the second-largest creditor, with 1.1 billion in long-term and  medium-term loans.  donald k. crowley, a banking industry analyst in the san francisco office of  the investment firm of keefe, bruyette &amp woods, said the suspension\\'s  impact on u.s. banks would be minimal because none is overexposed in venezuela.  but he said the venezuelan action came as a shock and would be significant if  it represented a move among latin american nations to adopt a common approach  to dealing with foreign creditors, which would give them more bargaining  leverage.  colombia\\'s suspension  on friday, colombia said for the first time that it was suspending payment on  its 16.5-billion foreign debt for three months until a new 1.7-billion  international loan is received.  louis g. schirano, an executive in the new york offices of los angeles-based  first interstate bancorp., said he did not interpret the venezuelan move as a  major setback. he said that venezuela, which will continue paying interest on  its debt, has simply joined the other latin debtors in suspending its principal  payments.  \"what banks really care about is the debt service (interest) and that will  still be flowing,\" said schirano, whose bank has divested itself of all  venezuelan debt.  latin america\\'s largest debtor nations are brazil, 113 billion mexico, 108  billion and argentina, 54 billion. unlike venezuela, all three have halted  interest payments to foreign banks at various times.  debt action urged  the presidents of all four nations, along with three other latin american  countries, have urged the united states to make the debt problem a major  political priority. bush\\'s remarks about reviewing u.s. efforts have been  interpreted in some quarters as a move to possibly forgive some portion of the  huge debt owed to private banks by third world countries.  the previous u.s. strategy for dealing with the problem, the so-called baker  plan, was designed in 1985 by then-treasury secretary james a. baker iii, who  will be bush\\'s secretary of state. he called for commercial banks and the world  bank to provide new loans in return for growth-oriented economic changes in the  debtor nations.  but new lending has been rare. the 17 countries that are most deeply in debt  owe 529 billion and paid 14 billion more to creditors than they received in  new loans in 1987, the latest year for which figures are available.  a u.n. development organization said in september that commercial banks should  forgive at least 30% of the amount owed by the 15 most heavily indebted third  world countries. the u.n. conference on trade and development said that was the  only way of giving the nations the opportunity to retain enough capital to grow  faster and repay the remainder of the debt.  while venezuela\\'s economy is in better shape than that of most of the other  debtors, the sharp two-year decline in oil prices has caused problems.  on friday, the government raised tariffs sharply to restrain imports and  conserve its cash reserves. tariffs were increased as much as 160% on about 500  consumer items, ranging from electronics to liquor.

       "  'text': 'at the time, republican presidential contender ronald reagan called it \"a  shabby, needless blow.\" his intra-party rival, george bush, branded it \"an  abject american retreat.\" and then-sen. john tower (r-tex.) termed it  \"unconscionable.\"  despite such criticism, 10 years ago today, on jan. 1, 1979, the jimmy carter  administration broke formal u.s. ties with taiwan and established diplomatic  relations with the people\\'s republic of china.  \"we are recognizing a simple reality,\" president carter said.  but, as a matter of american foreign policy, it had been anything but simple.  for nearly three decades, the united states had refused to recognize the  communist regime in beijing and had pretended that the chinese nationalists on  taiwan were the government for all of china.  now, 10 years later, the entire relationship between the united states and  china has changed. new assumptions govern the behavior of both nations, and  u.s. scholars predict that in the next few years the two governments may find  themselves in increasing conflict with one another on a number of foreign  policy questions, such as the middle east and cambodia.  \"it seems to me that china and the united states won\\'t be as close as they were  before,\" said thomas w. robinson of the american enterprise institute. \"there  has to be a certain distancing on both sides.\"  on the one hand, during the last decade the u.s. recognition of beijing -- and  its avoidance of official dealings with taiwan -- has become an established,  accepted fact in american domestic politics.  president reagan, once one of taiwan\\'s closest friends in american politics,  honored the u.s. recognition of beijing last month by saying he is confident  that the united states and china will \"forge even stronger ties and build a  safer, more prosperous world.\" taiwan, meanwhile, has managed to survive and  prosper despite its diplomatic isolation.  no longer in tandem  on the other hand, the united states and china no longer operate in close  tandem with one another in international affairs in the way that they did a  decade ago. the common bond of shared opposition to the soviet union has frayed  as the united states and china separately seek warmer ties with the government  of president mikhail s. gorbachev.  \"there is an increasing sense that the era in which the bilateral relationship  (between the united states and china) was based importantly on opposition to  moscow has ended,\" university of washington prof. nicholas r. lardy wrote  recently.  during the last two years the united states and china have been at odds over a  number of issues.  chinese arms sales an issue  u.s. officials voiced bitter complaints about china\\'s arms sales to the middle  east, including the sale of silkworm anti-ship missiles to iran and  intermediate-range ballistic missiles to saudi arabia. china took umbrage at  u.s. congressional resolutions denouncing china\\'s policies on human rights and  in tibet.  as if to symbolize the current atmosphere of mistrust, china recently imposed  new travel restrictions on american diplomats working at consulates in the  chinese cities of shenyang and shanghai. the united states called these curbs  \"unreasonable\" and countered by slapping new limits on personnel at the chinese  consulate in chicago.  that sort of reciprocal nastiness would have been unthinkable 10 years ago.  in the first place, the united states and china did not even have any diplomats  living and working in the heartland of each other\\'s territory. second, both  nations were eager to set aside all sources of conflict at the time to work  together against the perceived soviet threat.  wanted strategic partner  \"the united states didn\\'t have too much choice,\" said one west european  diplomat who follows chinese affairs. \"china was looking for a strategic  partner against the soviet union. it found two countries who were willing to  play the game: japan and the united states.\"  although president richard m. nixon had moved to normalize ties with beijing  during his historic 1972 visit to china, neither he nor his successor,  president gerald r. ford, was able to establish diplomatic relations with the  communist regime. they were never able to overcome the strong support for  taiwan\\'s nationalist regime in the right wing of the republican party.  consider, for example, the time then-sen. barry goldwater (r-ariz.) resorted to  strong-arm tactics against ford and secretary of state henry a. kissinger.  one day in may, 1976, goldwater sent a private ultimatum to the ford white  house. he said he had heard a radio report that the ford administration was  planning to establish diplomatic relations with \"red china,\" either before or  after the november elections.  \\'don\\'t intend to stay quiet\\'  \"it doesn\\'t make any sense to me to forgo our friends on taiwan and i don\\'t  intend to stay quiet about it, so please within 24 hours let me know what the  truth is, and i mean the truth,\" goldwater wrote. he threatened to withdraw  political support for ford, who was then being challenged by reagan for the  republican presidential nomination.  according to files at the gerald r. ford presidential library, ford and  kissinger were forced to cave in. within a day, kissinger called goldwater and  gave him the assurances that were necessary to avoid a public dispute.  it was left to carter, a democratic president, to take the political heat of  recognizing china, and he, too, delayed doing so until soon after the 1978  congressional elections. when carter finally made the public announcement, on  dec. 15, 1978, he was immediately savaged by conservative republicans.  within a month, reagan was not only criticizing carter\\'s recognition of  beijing, but also advocating \"continuation of government-to-government  relations between the united states and taiwan.\"  reagan brought testy period  reagan\\'s arrival in the white house precipitated a testy period in which china  was unsure how much support the new president would give to taiwan. the tension  eased with a 1982 agreement limiting u.s. arms sales to taiwan and, ultimately,  with reagan\\'s own election-year visit to china in 1984.  during that trip, the president minimized the ideological differences with  china that had once preoccupied american conservatives by referring to china as  a \"so-called communist country.\"  by the mid-1980s, the united states and china began to set aside -- or perhaps  postpone for the future -- their disputes over taiwan. the two countries even  began to collaborate on a series of military exchanges, with pentagon officials  making regular visits to china and leaders of the chinese people\\'s liberation  army touring military installations in the united states.  but the two sides began to fight over other issues. china, sensitive to charges  by third world countries that it was aligning itself too closely with the  united states, announced that it was conducting an \"independent\" foreign  policy. the united states began to complain about china\\'s arms sales overseas  and to worry about china\\'s continuing support for the murderous khmer rouge in  cambodia.  trade and students  whenever the two sides bicker, u.s. officials explain that ties with china  remain strong. they point to the increasing trade between the two countries --  more than 13 billion this year -- and the high number of chinese students, an  estimated 32,000 to 40,000, being educated at american universities.  one senior reagan administration official said last year that china and the  united states now have a \"mature\" relationship, suggesting that the two  countries are like a married couple, able to withstand a good fight once in a  while.  some american scholars found such bland explanations irritating. \"if i hear one  more state department official talk about a \\'mature relationship\\' with china,  i\\'m going to scream,\" said robinson. \"it\\'s as if the chinese were juveniles  before now.\"  indeed, although u.s. officials have gone to great lengths to stress the calm  and continuity in sino-american relations, the underlying american attitudes  toward china have been changing in some significant ways during the last  decade.  deng toured u.s.  ten years ago, u.s. officials pinned their hopes for china\\'s future largely on  china\\'s top political leadership. within weeks after diplomatic relations were  established in 1979, chinese leader deng xiaoping made a triumphal tour of the  united states. u.s. officials were effusive in their praise of deng and the  reform program he was beginning to launch in china.  now, deng is 84, and some american officials and scholars have suggested  privately that he is becoming arbitrary and erratic in his leadership, in much  the same way as did mao tse-tung in the final years before his death in 1976.  last spring, for example, deng seemed to call for a lifting of price controls  and then to pull back in the face of a spurt of inflation.  u.s. officials are also critical of some of the chinese leaders who may succeed  deng. speaking of chinese premier li peng, who was trained and educated in the  soviet union, one reagan administration official said recently: \"li peng just  doesn\\'t understand how a market economy works. things won\\'t really move in  china until after his years in power.\"  these days, american hopes for china seem to rest not on its political elite,  but on broader, long-range developments in chinese society -- particularly the  tens of thousands of young students being educated in the united states and the  market-oriented economic reforms that are taking hold in china at the  grass-roots.  divided over policy  at the moment, there appear to be serious divisions among american  policy-makers and scholars about how the united states should approach china in  the next few years.  some american experts say that the united states should now base its ties to  china primarily on economic cooperation and shift focus away from strategic  factors such as joint opposition to the soviet union. \"the relationship (with  china) from the beginning has been premised far too much on anti-soviet  factors,\" lardy said.  but one reagan administration official, who said that he personally agrees with  this argument, acknowledged: \"there are still people in senior policy ranks in  the united states who view china strictly in strategic terms.\"  in a recent speech in san francisco, u.s. ambassador to china winston lord  declared: \"contrary to some fashionable pundits, i strongly believe strategic  factors will remain crucial to our cooperation with china. . . . they are more  muted and nuanced than before. but our two nations share a continuing stake in  preserving global and regional balances.\"  ten years ago, at the time they established diplomatic relations, the united  states and china were drawn together by their eagerness to join hands against  the soviet union. now, american scholars say, nothing between china and the  united states is quite so easy.  \"if people want a clear, compelling basis for u.s.-china relations these days,  there just isn\\'t going to be one,\" harry harding of the brookings institution  said. \"except that we are two big countries that are going to have to live with  one another.\"  '},\n",

       "  'text': 'soviet president mikhail s. gorbachev, in a televised new year\\'s address  saturday, called on the soviet people to stop sitting on the sidelines and to  show greater \"gumption\" in pursuing his policy of economic reform.  gorbachev acknowledged that perestroika, his program to restructure soviet  society, had raised high hopes among the citizens that had not yet been met.  the 57-year-old kremlin leader, who took office in march of 1985, blamed  conservative forces in part for the slow pace of reform.  but, using tough language, he also said that every soviet citizen should do  more to improve the quality of consumer goods and to end the shortages that  have typified soviet life since the 1930s.  \\'greater resoluteness\\'  \"one cannot just outwit life and sit back on the sidelines,\" gorbachev said.  \"it is essential to act with greater resoluteness.\"  he said his attempt to revamp soviet society \"lends wings to real champions . .  . and gives them added energies and gumption. and this is just what we need now  most of all.\"  his remarks seem to respond to critics who complained bitterly to him during a  trip to siberia in september of long -- and often unsuccessful -- waits to  obtain basic consumer goods.  those dramatic encounters were carried on soviet television, and western  analysts said the complaints helped to push gorbachev to make major  governmental changes in october, putting reform-minded supporters in positions  of power.  gorbachev\\'s year-end speech was broadcast across the country on soviet  television just minutes before midnight and was probably widely seen. new  year\\'s eve in the soviet union is a family holiday that traditionally includes  the exchange of gifts and the viewing of special television programs until  early morning hours.  \"i do not want, and have no right, to paint a rosy overall picture,\" the  communist party leader said in the broadcast. \"perestroika gave rise to great  expectations to society, but changes are not coming as fast as we would all  like them to . . . . demand still outstrips supply, especially when it comes to  quality goods.  \"this,\" he added, \"is explained in a large measure not only by the inertia of  the past but also by the novelty of problems and the real difficulties of  organizing life in a new way.\"  letters to officials have revealed soviet concerns about how perestroika would  affect individuals in the society where everyone is guaranteed a job and the  state subsidizes everything from bread to apartments.  in his address, gorbachev warned that perestroika would mean greater individual  responsibility. he said the changes would include more reliance on \"the  pay-your-own-way system . . . and a broadened scope for initiatives and social  enterprise.\"  \\'have to get in the mood\\'  \"we all have to get into the mood for such work,\" he added.  on the topic of international relations, gorbachev claimed that the soviet  union, acting \"in the spirit of the new political thinking,\" was largely  responsible for the thaw in the cold war between east and west. the soviets  have learned to listen to the positions of other countries while still \"abiding  by our own principles,\" he said.  \"of course, the shadows of the past are present in world politics,\" the soviet  leader added. \"but they are fading already. a new vision of the world is being  established.\"  on other subjects, gorbachev referred briefly to the nationalist unrest that  has torn parts of the soviet union. at least 31 people were killed in november  in ethnic violence in the southwestern republics of armenia and azerbaijan.  \"we are proceeding to another important phase of political reform, which will  aim to harmonize inter-ethnic relations,\" he said.  he also spoke of the dec. 7 earthquake in armenia, which the soviet union has  said claimed tens of thousands of lives.  \"the end of the year was darkened by anguish,\" he said. \"our misfortune has  evoked warmth, sympathy and response around the world.\"  '},\n",

       "  'text': 'for the second consecutive year, president reagan and soviet president mikhail  s. gorbachev exchanged new year\\'s greetings for the soviet and american people,  each saluting the sharp improvement in u.s.-soviet relations during 1988.  the exchange of videotaped messages, each about five minutes long, for  broadcast on soviet and american television, reflected the new ease with which  reagan, who took office as perhaps the most anti-communist leader in recent  u.s. history, has been dealing with the soviet union in general and gorbachev  in particular.  as if recognizing this, gorbachev said in his remarks -- a text of which was  made public saturday by the white house -- that \"americans seem to be  rediscovering the soviet union -- and we are rediscovering america. fears and  suspicion are gradually giving way to trust and feelings of mutual liking.  \"last year was rich in momentous events. it also brought many good changes in  relations between our peoples and countries,\" the soviet leader added. \"today  they are more dynamic and more humane. we have become closer, and we have come  to know each other better.\"  similarly, reagan told the soviet people, \"i am confident that relations  between our two countries will continue on the positive course they have  followed in the year just ending.  \"despite our disagreements, we have been able to find some common ground,\" he  added, singling out human rights, arms control, regional problems and  u.s.-soviet relations in general.  the reagan-gorbachev exchange was broadcast in full by abc and nbc. cbs used  excerpts from both talks on its evening news program.  difference from last year  in tone and specific content, the speeches by the two leaders reflected the  positive course in relations, when compared with the addresses each delivered  one year ago. at that time, reagan used the soviet airwaves to gently prod the  kremlin on such sensitive issues as human rights and regional disputes, while  giving a condensed introduction to american society that offered the soviet  audience a glimpse of american holiday traditions and a miniature civics  lesson.  and two years ago, gorbachev declared that after the failures of the october,  1986, summit conference in iceland, superpower relations were too poor to  justify an exchange of new year\\'s greetings. so, reagan\\'s message that year,  broadcast on the voice of america, was blotted out by electronic jamming in  much of the soviet bloc.  reagan\\'s 1989 message was videotaped on dec. 15 in the white house map room,  before the president flew to california for a two-week vacation.  the president said that in human rights, \"progress is being made in  reunification of families, freedom of people to travel as they please, and in  other areas.\" he also said that the halt in electronic jamming is a positive  step.  \\'solutions being found\\'  \"in regional issues, from afghanistan to the persian gulf and southern africa,  solutions are being found to conflicts of many years\\' standing,\" reagan said,  challenging the soviets to join \"in the effort to bring peace, democracy and  security to central america\" -- a region to which gorbachev made no reference  in his speech.  reagan also challenged the soviets to go beyond the 500,000-troop cut in  conventional forces that gorbachev announced at the united nations on dec. 7.  the troop reduction, reagan said, is \"certainly a step in the right direction  of correcting the imbalances in the european military situation.\"  administration change  both the american and soviet presidents, recognizing the change in  administrations that is about to occur in the united states, predicted that  president-elect george bush would bring an element of continuity to the two  nations\\' relations.  \"we can look ahead with optimism to the future of our relations. this is what  we talked about with president-elect bush,\" gorbachev said, referring to his  meeting with bush in new york on the day of the u.n. speech.  less optimistic approach  in his weekly radio address broadcast in the united states, reagan took a  slightly less optimistic approach, stating that u.s.-soviet relations can  continue to improve, but \"we must remain sober in our estimation of our  negotiating partners and without illusion . . . about their goals and aims.\"  whether seeking reduced tensions in relations with the soviet union or in the  middle east, the bush administration will need congressional support and  \"appropriate levels of defense spending,\" reagan said, adding, \"trust me, i  know.\"  the radio address was delivered from the palms spring estate of walter and  leonore annenberg, with whom the president and nancy reagan are spending the  new year\\'s holiday, as they have for nearly two decades. the festivities  included a black-tie new year\\'s eve dinner.  \\'policy of peace paying off\\'  as the new year arrived, the president declared in the radio speech that \"our  economy is healthy, our defenses are strong and our policy of peace through  strength is paying off in spades.\"  reagan\\'s optimism was tempered only by the bombing of pan am flight 103 on dec.  21.  \"now if, as seems likely, our terrorists have crawled out of their hole to  threaten american lives, i can promise them this: the pledge we made to seek  out the truth and punish the guilty is a sacred one which george bush shares,\"  he said.

       "  'text': 'the widely anticipated turn to the right by the newly aligned california  supreme court emerged in strikingly clear form in a range of decisions issued  during 1988.  in the past, under a liberal majority led by former chief justice rose  elizabeth bird, business, insurers and law enforcement repeatedly suffered  defeat. but last year, under a more conservative court led by chief justice  malcolm m. lucas, yesterday\\'s losers became today\\'s consistent winners.  the trend was underscored last week in the court\\'s long-awaited ruling on  wrongful discharge in which the justices limited the rights of workers to sue  their employers for an unjust dismissal -- a decision with sweeping impact on a  fast-growing area of employment law.  the ruling followed the justices\\' far-reaching reversal last august of a 1979  landmark ruling that had allowed accident victims to bring damage suits against  the wrongdoer\\'s insurance company for the bad-faith refusal to accept a claim.  uphold death sentences  on another front, the court, struggling to reduce a huge backlog of death  penalty appeals, issued 56 capital rulings in 12 months, upholding death  sentences 43 times.  in the nine years ending in january, 1987, with the departure of bird and two  other justices defeated in the 1986 fall election, the court affirmed the death  penalty only four times in 68 rulings.  in other notable criminal law decisions last year, the court abandoned a past  ruling that had restricted the use of improperly obtained confessions, opened  the way for longer prison terms for repeat offenders and upheld a law aimed at  curbing sex offenses by prohibiting loitering at public restrooms.  throughout the year, the justices showed little inclination to seek societal  reform through ground-breaking court decisions -- a trademark of the court for  the nearly three decades that it was under a liberal majority. the new court  looked for guidance from the u.s. supreme court and courts in other states and  expressed a desire to leave it to the legislature to make bold changes in state  law.  critics disturbed  the court\\'s sharp turn disturbs critics who, while expecting some shift toward  judicial conservatism, had hoped the change would not be so abrupt and  wide-ranging.  \"since the lucas court has taken over, we have had a series of decisions which  operate to deprive individuals of their economic rights while benefiting large  corporate institutions,\" said steven j. kaplan, a los angeles attorney who  represented the employee who brought the wrongful-dismissal case decided last  thursday.  \"this court, at a visceral level, is much more sympathetic to the corporate  world than its predecessor,\" kaplan said.  michael laurence, director of a newly formed death penalty project of the  american civil liberties union of northern california, raises concern over the  record pace of capital case rulings and the court\\'s tendency to uphold death  verdicts even though a procedural error has occurred at trial.  \"i am surprised that the court is not taking a closer look at some of these  cases,\" laurence said. \"this court is much more willing to find an error was  harmless than was the previous court.\"  but the beneficiaries of the shift on the court welcome what they see as a more  balanced approach and a greater effort to clarify the law for judges, lawyers  and litigants.  \"this court has a fuller appreciation of what\\'s involved in a criminal  prosecution and a real-life grasp of how a case moves through the judicial  system,\" said state chief assistant atty. gen. steve white.  \"in both the criminal and civil area of the law, the court is more inclined to  be sensible about the impact of a ruling on the judicial process,\" white said.  \"it seems much more interested in supplying guidance to all parties so we can  avoid error where possible.\"  in an ironic twist, the court issued several rulings in 1988 that went against  gov. george deukmejian, a leading critic of the bird court who named the five  justices to the seven-member court who formed a bloc that set a new  philosophical course in the law.  taken by surprise  this apparent assertion of independence from the influence by the republican  governor took some observers by surprise.  the justices ruled that deukmejian\\'s nominee for state treasurer, rep. daniel  e. lungren, could not take office with confirmation by only one house of the  legislature held that a commission made up of deukmejian appointees could not  establish a \"sub-minimum\" wage for employees receiving tips, and twice refused  to hear a deukmejian administration challenge to a 1981 bird court ruling that  struck down legislative restrictions on state-funded abortions for low-income  women.  nonetheless, the results in a broad range of decisions issued during the last  year signaled a marked change in direction from the old court.  in significant criminal law rulings, the court:  * upheld three of every four death penalty verdicts it reviewed and, while  issuing no particularly far-reaching decisions, made clear that it will not  overturn death sentences because of a procedural error that, realistically,  could not have affected the outcome of the case.  * ruled that prosecutors may use improperly obtained confessions to challenge  the truthfulness of a defendant\\'s testimony at trial. the justices, abandoning  a 1976 ruling barring any such use of incriminating statements, said that under  proposition 8, the 1982 victims\\' bill-of-rights initiative, state courts now  are bound by less-restrictive u.s. supreme court decisions on the issue.  * reversed a 1986 ruling by the old court and held that trial judges may review  a wider range of court records to determine whether convicted felons may be  sentenced to longer prison terms because of previous commission of a  residential burglary.  * held that the state board of prison terms properly rescinded the impending  parole of \"onion field\" killer gregory ulas powell based on new evidence that  his release could endanger public safety. the decision overturned a contrary  ruling by the bird court in 1986 that had opened the way for the release of the  convicted murderer of a los angeles police officer in 1963.  * reversing another decision under bird, held that trial judges need not warn  jurors that eyewitness identifications of suspected criminals may be unreliable  and should be viewed with caution. the debate over the reliability of such  identifications should be left to trial counsel and expert witnesses to argue  before the jury, the justices said.  * upheld the constitutionality of a state law making it a crime to loiter near  a public restroom. the court rejected arguments by civil libertarians that the  law would encourage discriminatory arrests against homosexuals.  * allowed the prosecution for manslaughter of a christian scientist parent  whose child died after her mother rejected medical assistance in favor of an  attempt to heal by prayer. parents, the court said, have no right to exercise  religious beliefs at the price of a child\\'s life.  in major civil decisions, the court:  * ruling in the milestone case of los angeles executive daniel d. foley, held  that an employee who is fired without good cause, in violation of a company  promise, can sue his employer only for lost pay and other economic loss.  awards for emotional distress and punitive damages, which could range into  hundreds of thousands of dollars, may not be obtained, the justices said. more  than 1,000 wrongful discharge suits are filed annually in the state. attorneys  predicted a sharp drop in such litigation because dismissed workers will have  less incentive to file suit and attorneys, working on a contingency-fee basis,  will be less willing to take on cases.  * overturned a major ruling by the bird court and held that accident victims  may not bring suit under state insurance law for the insurer\\'s refusal to  fairly settle a claim. the court noted that the previous ruling had been widely  criticized and rejected by most other states that had considered it. in  california, the justices said, the ruling had produced confusion, inequitable  results and high litigation costs.  * turned down a challenge by state atty. gen. john k. van de kamp to the  10.1-billion purchase of getty oil by texaco in 1984, ruling that state  antitrust law cannot be used to attack mergers by corporations.  * upheld the constitutionality of proposition 51, the \"deep-pockets\"  liability-reform initiative limiting damages for pain and suffering and other  non-economic injury in civil injury cases. however, the court, limiting the  immediate impact of the measure, ruled it will not apply to tens of thousands  of cases that were pending when it was passed by the voters in 1986.  * gave broad protection to prescription drug makers by holding that injured  consumers cannot collect damages unless they prove that firms were negligent in  making the drugs or in failing to warn of their potential dangers. in another  victory for manufacturers, the court also held that cancer victims are not  entitled to damages for injury from the drug des unless they filed suit within  a year after they first suspected harm from the substance.  * in a case watched closely by religious groups, ruled in a milestone \"clergy  malpractice\" suit that church pastors may not be held liable for the suicide of  a despondent youth to whom they had given spiritual counseling.  * said that the rev. sun myung moon\\'s unification church can be sued for fraud  for allegedly \"brainwashing\" unknowing recruits and tricking them into joining  the church.  * barred a single man from suing for the negligence-related death of his  live-in girlfriend, ruling that unmarried cohabitants are not entitled to the  same rights that the law gives married couples to bring such suits.

       "  'text': 'officials in the salvadoran government say that the 1980 assassination of  archbishop oscar arnulfo romero, which helped spark the nation\\'s civil war and  caused worldwide outrage, will remain unresolved because of a supreme court  ruling that the testimony of a key witness is not valid.  the ruling, handed down dec. 21, has caused an uproar in el salvador,  escalating the already heated presidential campaign rhetoric between the  christian democrats of president jose napoleon duarte and the rightist  nationalist republican alliance (arena), the main opposition party.  \"in fact, the case is now closed and justice has been mocked,\" said roberto  giron flores, who, as attorney general, was investigating the case until he was  fired dec. 23 by the arena-controlled national assembly.  u.s. officials, who invested much time and effort in the case, were outraged by  the ruling and are making that displeasure known, but diplomatic and political  sources say the americans acknowledge that nothing can be done to revive the  case.  romero, a charismatic, outspoken opponent of rightist death squads and military  repression, was killed by a single shot through the heart on march 24, 1980,  while saying mass. it was the most publicized killing of thousands carried out  by the death squads, and duarte had vowed to punish those responsible.  former u.s. ambassador robert e. white asserted that the killing was ordered by  roberto d\\'aubuisson, a founder of arena and currently a legislator in the  national assembly. d\\'aubuisson has denied the allegation.  in november, 1987, duarte made public testimony given to investigators by amado  garay, identified as the driver of the getaway car in the killing. garay said  that he worked for alvaro saravia, a cashiered salvadoran air force captain and  protege of d\\'aubuisson. garay said that after the killing, saravia reported on  the success of the operation to d\\'aubuisson.  d\\'aubuisson declared at the time that garay was lying and rejected the  allegations.  based on garay\\'s testimony, after he passed numerous lie-detector tests and  other elements of his testimony were investigated, the salvadoran government,  with u.s. help, asked for saravia\\'s extradition from miami, where he was living  illegally.  saravia was arrested in miami for violating the terms of his visa, and has been  held since, as the extradition request proceeded. he was to have been  extradited in early january, according to legal sources.  but the salvadoran supreme court, described by knowledgeable diplomats and  christian democrats as dominated by the far right, ruled dec. 21 that there  were no grounds for arresting saravia if he returned to el salvador and that  the extradition request itself was illegal.  the court ruled that delay in presentation of garay\\'s evidence, after \"seven  years, seven months and 24 days, completely undermines the credibility of his  testimony\" and resulted in no evidence linking saravia to the killing.  \"the problem here is that we have to understand the judicial system has been  totally dominated by arena, which blocks the investigation and application of  justice,\" said antonio morales erlich, secretary general of the christian  democrats. \"i want to say as a lawyer that the witness and evidence presented  in the romero case were ample to proceed with an arrest order.\"  on dec. 23, the assembly, in its last session of the year and with only the  arena deputies supporting the move, fired giron flores as attorney general,  alleging \"incompetence and immorality,\" and named arena sympathizer roberto  garcia alvarado to replace him.  \"the truth is that i was fired for a simple and fundamental reason -- because  the romero case was about to be resolved,\" giron flores said. \"saravia was  about to return and we were going to discover who was responsible. . . . the  romero case is now closed, and i was fired so the case could be closed.\"  knowledgeable observers say that giron flores is correct, because, by ruling  that the testimony was too old -- although no salvadoran law places time limits  on the validity of testimony -- any new evidence or testimony will be thrown  out on the same grounds.  \"on legal and procedural grounds, the case is dead,\" said one person familiar  with the case.  gregorio rosa chavez, auxiliary bishop of san salvador, after a mass on  christmas day, said, \"in the church, we think (saravia) has valuable  information on this act which convulsed the country.\"  arena\\'s presidential candidate, alfredo cristiani, said that giron flores was  fired for \"demonstrable reasons showing he was not fit to continue in office,\"  and cristiani accused the christian democrats of throwing up a \"smoke screen\"  and \"politicizing\" the matter by trying to link the firing to the romero case.  the investigation into romero\\'s killing was being handled by a special  investigative unit that had received u.s. training. according to two people  involved in the investigation, saravia was also to be charged upon his return  here with the kidnaping and murder in 1985 of carlos guerra campos, a wealthy  coffee grower. investigators said that they planned to use the guerra campos  case to force saravia to give evidence in the romero case.  \"it was to be our checkmate move,\" one investigator said.  investigators also said that garay had identified dr. hector antonio regalado,  a dentist, as the triggerman in the murder, although they said that there was  no hard evidence other than garay\\'s statement linking him to the shooting.  regalado, an expert marksman, was head of security at the constituent assembly  when d\\'aubuisson was president of that body in the early 1980s.  earlier this year, two men who worked in the assembly at that time said that  regalado ran right-wing death squads from the building.

       "  'text': 'four people, including a woman on her way to work and a young man playing  \"chicken\" with friends, were killed by trains in southern california, two of  them in los angeles county, police said saturday.  in the first incident, at 7 p.m. friday, lorenzo ruelas, 35, of oxnard was  killed when he was hit by an amtrak passenger train traveling 70 m.p.h. outside  oxnard, ventura county sheriff\\'s sgt. carl schoenberger said. it has not been  determined why ruelas was walking on the tracks.  two hours later shawn james schultz, 21, of escondido was playing the daredevil  game \"chicken\" with friends when he put his head on the tracks and was struck  and killed by a southbound amtrak train in oceanside, officer lori conway said.  the amtrak train bound for san diego from los angeles was traveling about 30  m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h. as it moved through the city about 40 miles north of san  diego, said police sgt. richard derouen.  the friends did nothing as the engine ran over shultz because \"the object of  the game is to see how long you can stay down,\" derouen explained.  at 3 a.m. saturday a heavily tattooed man lying on railroad tracks in sun  valley was run over by a freight train and killed, authorities said.  the train\\'s crew told officers they saw the man as the locomotive approached  but were unable to stop in time, sgt. william meier said. the victim, who was  carrying no identification papers, had not been identified by late saturday.  at 6 a.m. saturday, a woman walking to work was struck and killed by a freight  train as she stumbled and fell across tracks in el monte, sgt. steve schuster  said.  mary louise johnson, 30, of temple city was pronounced dead at the scene,  schuster said.  johnson was carrying a small bag containing her lunch when she stumbled while  walking across a triple-track area. she was hit when she reached to pick up the  contents of the bag, he said.  \"it was still dark at the time,\" schuster said. he speculated that she  misjudged the speed of the train.

       "  'text': 'one year ago, their election began the most complete overhaul of the san diego  city council in a decade. four educated, ambitious, politically savvy men --  they were the first group to take their seats together as newcomers since 1977.  they were instantly nicknamed the four freshmen, and they almost as quickly  predicted that they could become a force on the nine-member council.  \"we\\'re going into office as a coalition of sorts,\" district 8 councilman bob  filner said the day after he was elected with the 2nd district\\'s ron roberts,  4th district\\'s wes pratt and 6th district\\'s bruce henderson. \"people may wonder  how or where the mayor and the current council members might get votes from us.  but, on the other hand, with four of us coming in, we only need to pick up one  vote to do what we want to.\"  as filner could best attest, it has not worked out that way. the freshmen\\'s  political differences soon dashed any semblance of a coalition forged in the  heat of the campaign, and their fortunes have followed divergent paths.  but each began to carve a niche for himself as the council fought and lost the  battle to rein in growth, confirmed a new police chief, selected a site for a  new civic center, grappled with an expensive sewage problem, authorized yet  another study of how to relocate the airport, endorsed mayor maureen o\\'connor\\'s  soviet arts festival and raised hotel taxes to pay for it.  here is a look, in district order, at the four freshmen\\'s first two semesters.  the day after he was elected, district 2 councilman, ron roberts promised to  \"hit the ground running.\" these days, it is said around city hall, roberts is  running -- for mayor.  a friend to all issues  roberts, whose district stretches from point loma to mission hills, greets  returning warships, fires starter\\'s pistols at track meets, cuts ribbons,  accepts awards and gives speeches. his energy is so boundless, his presence so  ubiquitous, his name in the news so often, that it is difficult to remember he  has been on council only a year.  roberts has yet to meet an issue he doesn\\'t like. whether it is growth  management, safety and noise at lindbergh field or sewage treatment and water  reclamation, roberts has studied it, and he has a plan for improving it.  more than any of the four new council members -- perhaps more than any other  council member except gloria mccoll -- roberts has nimbly stepped into the  power vacuum created by the city\\'s weak mayor form of government and o\\'connor\\'s  hands-off leadership style.  mixed reviews  at year\\'s end, he had positioned himself in a tenuous coalition of five  moderate-to-conservative republicans that could dominate the nine-member  council if its members can overcome longstanding differences among them. at the  same time, he remains close to o\\'connor, who endorsed only him among the eight  candidates in the 1987 election.  some of roberts\\' adventures have backfired. an attempt to remove the city\\'s  highly successful motion picture and television bureau from the chamber of  commerce led to an embarrassing defeat and ill will from the chamber. \"i would  do that differently if i had it all to do over again,\" he said.  slow-growth activists, who had high hopes for roberts when o\\'connor endorsed  him as \"someone who knows how to say \\'no\\' to developers,\" now consider him the  architect of some of proposition h\\'s worst features.  \"ron roberts talks like mr. rogers but votes like attila the hun,\" was a  standard campaign stump line from citizens for limited growth\\'s peter navarro.  roberts deftly handles speculation about his ambition. \"the things i\\'m doing  are because that\\'s how i interpret the job of being on the council. if there  is, at a later date, a reward in citizens  saying, \\'we\\'re willing to to let you step up to a higher office,\\' that\\'s fine.\"  o\\'connor, who this month began a new four-year term in office, has heard the  whispers about roberts\\' ambition but is unconcerned.  \"i have to tell you, i think they\\'re all running for mayor. everybody\\'s running  for mayor. secretly, and i\\'ll talk generically, any council member who serves  as a council member has kind of a little, secret desire to one day be mayor,\"  she said.  \"my philosophy is \\'good government is good politics,\\' \" she added, \"i work  hard, i try to serve the community well. it\\'s their choice. what will be will  be.\"  high-profile concerns  blessed with intelligence, drive and an all-american, good-guy personality,  roberts has benefited from the fact that the issues he is best able to tackle  are among the city\\'s most high-profile concerns.  roberts\\' district includes lindbergh field, so he is a natural to work on the  pressing matters of noise and safety at the airport -- issues watched closely  throughout the region. point loma is home to the city\\'s only sewage treatment  plant, so roberts has become outspoken on the city\\'s need for a 1.5-billion  upgrading of its sewer-treatment system, and, more specifically, on the need to  develop water reclamation technology.  as an architect and former chairman of the planning commission, roberts was  installed as chairman of the committee that wrote proposition h, the council\\'s  growth-management plan. he became the leading spokesman for it during the  unsuccessful election campaign.  but roberts\\' success is mostly of his own making. he worked with point loma  residents and the port district to fashion the compromise plan approved this  month that will limit noise from takeoffs and landings at lindbergh. he has  ridden in an airplane cockpit to assess the danger, if any, posed by the laurel  travel center building at the foot of the airport runway. he is involved in  discussions with the navy to reshape the landscape at the foot of broadway.  somehow, roberts finds time for his district. he has worked to revitalize ocean  beach and is helping point loma\\'s planning board devise ways to lessen  peak-hour traffic, caused largely by sailors, on catalina boulevard and  rosecrans street.  \"that man is working day and night,\" said ann jackson, chairman of the  peninsula community planning board. \"i feel very fortunate that he chose to  leave the architectural profession and try serving the city and the community.  he\\'s doing a wonderful job.\"  roberts points to a new downtown plan, a new waterfront plan, the  growth-control debate and the airport as his major issues in 1989. he also will  be heavily involved in the council\\'s redistricting efforts and is rumored to  want to add a chunk of downtown to his district.  wes pratt took office, took one look at the crying needs in his impoverished  council district and took to the streets of southeast san diego. he lectures  schoolchildren on the evils of drugs, marches to protest gang violence and goes  door-to-door exhorting homeowners in the battle against crack dealers.  long before district elections were approved by voters in the november, pratt,  the council\\'s lone black member, focused his energy on the concerns of his  largely minority constituents in the 4th district, which includes southeast san  diego, encanto, paradise hills and most of the california 94 corridor. if that  meant that his colleagues would grab the limelight, so be it.  \"i decided i would simply concentrate on district-related issues and getting  out into the district,\" he said.  his record is true to that decision. in his first year, pratt sought more money  for social services to aids victims, a growing concern of the minority  community. he championed the losing charter review commission ballot initiative  for a tough police review board and was critical of the police shooting of  tommie dubose during an arrest.  he was actively involved in the negotiations to sell southeast\\'s san diego  physicians &amp surgeons hospital, and at year\\'s end was leading the effort to  have the city\\'s convention center named for dr. martin luther king jr., the  slain civil rights leader  staying above the fray  pratt has developed a reputation for staying above the fray on city hall\\'s 10th  floor, where the deal-cutting and alliance-building among council members can  be fast-paced. that stance has allowed pratt to acquire some power as a  somewhat unpredictable swing vote on the nine-member council. it was pratt, for  example, who came back from his sickbed to break a 4-4 tie on the size of the  increase of the city\\'s hotel room tax.  \"i didn\\'t ask to be in that position,\" he said. \"it\\'s just the way i conduct  myself in the city council is to be pretty straightforward and not ally myself  with one faction or another.\"  herb cawthorne, executive director of the san diego urban league, believes  pratt \"has done an exceptional job. he\\'s surprised a lot of people with his  ability to grasp the larger issues. he has a tremendous amount of pressure on  him, because his balance makes him the swing factor a lot of times.  \"i think, as he matures, he will learn to exercise the power in more  far-reaching ways,\" cawthorne added.  george stevens, an aide to rep. jim bates (d-san diego) and pratt\\'s opponent in  the council race, praises pratt for his stand on the police review issue and  for his responsiveness to neighborhood needs.  but stevens believes that pratt should be supporting a committee recommendation  to include king\\'s full name in the convention center title instead of pratt\\'s  proposal of \"san diego king convention center.\" and he believes pratt should  have gotten an even larger share of this year\\'s community development block  grant money than the 2 million his district received.  a rare politician who does not feel the need to give extended speeches before  each vote, the quiet, burly pratt has earned the respect of colleagues with his  allegiance to doing what is right.  \"wes pratts don\\'t come along very often,\" said mayor maureen o\\'connor. \"he\\'s  got a rare quality about him.\" and \"99% of the time he\\'s on the side of the  angels,\" she added.  \"i basically want to be about the business of good government,\" pratt said. \"i  will continue to do that. i don\\'t feel i have to wave a big flag. wes pratt is  not going to be here forever. people have to take up the mantle and serve.\"  bruce henderson has taken a prominent role in some important citywide and  district issues. henderson was the architect of proposition k, the advisory  ballot measure calling for a mandatory, citywide program of staggered work  hours to reduce peak-hour traffic congestion.  along with several other council members, he has championed an ordinance to  preserve single-family neighborhoods, which make up a sizable part of his 6th  district, which includes pacific beach, mission beach and clairemont. he led  the fight to equip the city\\'s police force with two helicopters captured from  drug runners. one chopper is now operating and the other is being outfitted.  henderson continues to be the council\\'s maverick on its 1.5-billion sewer  system upgrade, insisting that the effort is not necessary. he also led  opposition to a 1.5-million consulting contract to publicize the issue,  narrowly losing his effort to sharply reduce the program, but managing to pare  300,000 from the price tag.  despite that sizable first-year agenda, henderson is best known inside city  hall for the publicity stunts, his long, sometimes unfocused speeches and his  class-clown tendency to interrupt colleagues during council sessions.  blowup sharks, posters  henderson has filled the council chamber with the ominous background music from  the film \"jaws\" and adorned the room with inflatable sharks to make his point  that \"consultant sharks\" are feeding on public tax dollars. he altered a \"jaws\"  poster to show the shark munching a dollar bill.  his \"fly me\" poster focused attention on the helicopters. he handed out a  commuter survival kit at a press conference to exhort voters to approve  proposition k.  henderson has \"a sense of humor, a different way of doing things,\" said  o\\'connor, who concedes she has at times become exasperated trying to silence  henderson at council meetings. \"he has fun and doesn\\'t take it personally. . .  . he does make you laugh.  \"he tries to exaggerate to make his point. and, through his exaggerations, he  makes his points. that\\'s his way of doing it.\"  henderson agrees that he\\'s trying \"just to have a little fun\" during council  meetings that can stretch eight hours or more.  \"the sharks captured the council\\'s attention,\" he said. \"i didn\\'t win, but at  least i saved the city 300,000.\"  admits to \\'fine line\\'  but, he acknowledges, \"i have to be careful because there\\'s a fine line between  using them and amusing (council members) and over-using them and irritating  (council members).\"  behind the clowning, council members agree, is a keen mind and a financial  acumen that many other council members lack. henderson has also concentrated on  his district, focusing on a traffic study of mission bay, pacific beach and la  jolla and closely scrutinizing requests for exemptions from the city\\'s interim  development ordinance in his neighborhoods.  he has also maneuvered himself into the chairmanship of the public facilities  and recreation committee, where he will have a more direct impact on mission  bay park.  henderson was perhaps the council\\'s most outspoken opponent of the  growth-management plan, though he did vote for it after weeks of negotiation.  \"i didn\\'t like h . . ., \" he said of proposition h. \"i was very pleased by the  voters, that they rejected it.\" henderson called the voters\\' decision \"a  reaffirmation of representative democracy,\" because it put the future of growth  management back in the council\\'s hands.  henderson, \"i think, has been less of an environmental supporter than we had  expected,\" said barbara bamberger, the sierra club\\'s conservation coordinator.  \"and we didn\\'t expect much.\"  this has not been bob filner\\'s month.  it started nov. 29 when a coalition of five council members relieved him of  1.7 million in community development block grant funds that city manager john  lockwood had recommended for his 8th district. the following day, the same  group turned down o\\'connor\\'s suggestion that filner head a council committee  and installed henderson as chairman instead.  a week later, they were at it again, refusing to allow filner to represent the  council on the metropolitan transit development board.  filner\\'s colleagues say they were trying to teach him a lesson. they say he is  abrasive, that he takes political and philosophical debate and raises it to the  level of personal attack.  \"bob tends to personalize it: \\'you\\'re evil, you\\'re bad, you\\'re mean, you\\'ve  broken the law, and i don\\'t like you, and i\\'m going to take my football and go  home,\\' \" henderson said.  roberts, one of the group of moderate-to-conservative republicans who  engineered filner\\'s thrashing, claims he was motivated by filner\\'s attempt,  during back-corridor wrangling over committee chairmanships, to put together a  slate that would have left roberts without a chairmanship.  convenient target?  filner remains defiant, claiming that the group he has dubbed \"the gang of  five\" was motivated by common ideological and political goals, not personal  ones. as perhaps the council\\'s most liberal member, filner believes he makes a  convenient target.  \"the defeat of the h and j has emboldened the pro-development forces on the  council,\" he said, referring to council members ron roberts, bruce henderson,  judy mccarty, ed struiksma and gloria mccoll. \"i think that\\'s what is behind  some of the recent votes with the gang of five.  \"there\\'s an ideological, partisan effort to make sure i am kept weak,\" he said.  he does not deny trying to put together a slate of committee chairmen without  roberts on it. \"why is my attempting to put together a slate that\\'s helpful to  me any worse or better than his trying to put together a slate that\\'s  beneficial to him?,\" he asked.  the answer is that roberts had the votes to win and filner didn\\'t. votes are  the bottom line, said andrea skorepa, executive director of a san ysidro social  service agency and a filner antagonist who supported his opponent, mike  aguirre, in the most recent election.  \"i think, for our community, he hasn\\'t been as effective a representative as he  could be,\" she said.  earlier in the year, filner watched helplessly as the council overruled his  recommendation and gave a publicly run recreation center in his district to  skorepa\\'s organization.  the internal conflict has overshadowed filner\\'s accomplishments in his large,  meandering district, which stretches from hillcrest through downtown and  includes san ysidro and otay mesa. a fanatical worker, he is perhaps the  council\\'s most cerebral member, who has a tendency to intellectual honesty even  if his views are not politically popular. he is on leave from san diego state  university, where he teaches history.  variety of concerns  filner was the only council member to oppose placing charter commission  initiatives directly on the ballot without review, arguing that the position  was an abdication of the council\\'s responsibilities. in recent months, some of  his colleagues have begun to agree.  filner guided the balboa park master plan to adoption, insisting that it call  for maximizing open space. he has brought capital improvement funds to south  bay parks and worked on the revitalization of san ysidro boulevard. last month  he called for higher taxes to put more police on city streets.  filner has proven himself one of the council\\'s most ardent slow-growth  advocates and remains a solid pro-environment vote. he has defended the sierra  club from attempts to oust the organization from its balboa park office.  \"bob filner is one of the few consistent supporters, who has been out there and  has been aggressively fighting for the preservation of open space and sensitive  lands,\" said the sierra club\\'s bamberger.  filner pledged to soften his tone if it will mean more success for his  district, which could be vulnerable in next year\\'s redistricting.  \"i\\'m willing to look at my own behavior,\" he said. \"if it\\'s hurting me from  achieving things for my district, that will change.\"  but he adds: \"i\\'m an outspoken person. i represent a district that has  historically been powerless. i\\'m going to continue to (be outspoken). if that  gets me into trouble, so be it.\"  '},\n",

       "  'text': 'the dec. 18 article (\"breaking camp\") relating to the housing problem of  migrant farm workers in north san diego county was indeed upsetting, but not  surprising.  during my four years as california state director of migrant education, i had  the opportunity to visit many migrant camps and other farm worker housing  throughout the state. the impressions leave a lasting dismal memory in my mind  . . . as well as deep anger that our society can treat one segment of our  population so callously.  to the farmer, as well as the community, the workers are an implement to be  used for bringing in the crops, then to be ignored, like machinery or farm  animals. they are not perceived as human beings. . . . like you and me.  yet they are very human . . . perhaps most of them are more decent humans than  many of us. they live in a close-knit family, loyal to each other, with high  moral values, and of deep religious beliefs. they are a proud people, unwilling  to take a \"handout\": welfare or social services for which they have not worked.  crime, drug or alcohol abuse is rare in these families.  housing is always a problem. they stay in a community for only part of a year.  thus, permanent housing is out of the question. rental payment for middle-class  apartments or houses is well beyond their means. so they are forced to live in  camps, caves, shacks, trailers, their cars . . . wherever. consequently, both  they and their children tend to be of poor health, with little chance to learn  english and not accepted as part of the community.  during the \\'60s, over 20 camps were built for the migratory farm workers in the  central valleys of california. the funds came from the federal government to  the state, which built the camps cooperatively with the counties, which then  managed the camps that were built on land donated by farmers. these facilities  are fairly decent temporary housing, and far better than the alternative. each  camp houses about 100 families and several hundred are turned away each year  because supply does not meet demand.  currently, i am on the board of directors of the coachella valley housing  coalition. we are a small, nonprofit organization, building farm worker  housing, both apartments and self-help homes. our first two projects, built  with federal and state funds, provided very decent multi-bedroom housing for  100 families, and we are funded for an additional 140 units. five hundred  families applied for the first 50 units. we\\'ll keep building until all families  are out of the ditches and shacks and filthy camps . . . or until the money  runs out.  so i read about the solution used in north san diego county: bulldoze the only  housing the farm workers have been able to provide for themselves! assure that  14,000 workers and their families are homeless. despite the rationalizations by  the local officials, this action is the most brutal which has yet come to my  attention.  i guess congressman ron packard (r-carlsbad) speaks for the majority of the  folks in that area when he throws the responsibility for finding housing and  meeting health regulations back on the migrant workers. i wish he could spend a  few days living under their circumstances.  there are solutions. let the growers, who need the workers, donate a few acres  each for camps. at the state level, proposition 84 specifically provides 10  million for the construction of migrant farm labor camps. it wouldn\\'t take  much, in terms of federal or state spending. and, provide something more decent  than the current proposal down there: a 14-foot plastic unit to house a family  of four. unbelievable! would congressman packard move his family into such a  unit?  just think! if readers of this letter are compassionate, or if they are  republicans who believe the private sector should solve all problems . . . if  all those readers contributed 10 each then that money might be sufficient to  house an awful lot of workers who provide the food on our table, and who live  worse than any other segment of our population.  but then, who really cares?  fred wolff  la quinta  ',\n",

       "  'text': 'if this renegade group of linguists could board a time machine, they probably  would press the accelerator to the floor -- moving backward through the ages to  a time before sanskrit, english, punjabi or japanese.  hurtling back to a remote part of the past before people ever learned to farm,  past the era when humans first used fire to a period 100,000 years ago.  that is the time they think they will find the critical evidence, the seedlings  that produced all of the world\\'s languages, something they like to call the  mother tongue of man.  such a discovery, this group of mostly soviet and east european researchers  believe, would prove what is called the monogenesis of language, the evolution  of the spoken word from a single tongue.  but while even these scientists think the 100,000-year mark could eventually  prove to be too deep in the remote past, they have made headway in  reconstructing hundreds of words they believe were spoken 15,000 to 30,000  years ago.  historical linguist vitaly shevoroshkin of the university of michigan in ann  arbor sees a host of applications for biology and anthropology in the work he  and his colleagues in the soviet union have done.  for one, the evolution of language not only shows \"how some words have become  petrified,\" by not changing much over time but also how people have migrated  around the world.  yet he laments the work has generated little interest in the west.  to hear shevoroshkin tell it, only a handful of americans are interested in  learning the words spoken by early homo sapiens sapiens, the prehistoric humans  whom paleobiologists believe first appeared 100,000 years ago and are the  direct ancestors of modern people.  shevoroshkin theorizes that it is possible to pinpoint at least a few original  words of man, elements from a language that served as the progenitor for all of  those ever spoken on earth.  \"we would like to reconstruct the proto-proto-proto language, if you will, the  mother tongue.  \"a proto language means a language family like indo-european. if you say  proto-proto that\\'s an ancestor of a family, not everybody accepts that idea  especially people in the west.  \"but when you say proto-proto-proto, that\\'s something completely different.  perhaps we may not find the mother tongue, the language of the world, maybe we  can go back only 30,000 years.  \"there is a big gap between people speaking some type of language 30,000 years  ago and one spoken 100,000 years ago. that is a very big gap and we don\\'t know  how to fill it.\"  as part of his quest, however, shevoroshkin hopes to find the links that tie  the world\\'s languages together and link them to the past.  to this end, he is building on the work of soviet linguists sergei starostin,  vladislav marakovic illic-svityc and aaron dolgopolsky who more than 20 years  ago tediously reconstructed a language spoken 15,000 years ago they call  nostratic, which means \"our language.\"  shevoroshkin said 1,000 words of nostratic have been reconstructed by analysis  of common elements from languages he and other scholars believe grew out of the  ancient tongue.  nostratic, they believe, gave rise to the indo-european, afro-asiatic,  kartvelian, euralic, dravidian, altaic and eskimo-aleutian language families.  hence, making nostratic a superfamily of languages, or as shevoroshkin would  put it -- a proto-proto language.  his hope is to continue on to the proto-proto-proto stage, if he can find the  clues that will link him to the remote past.  language is unique to the human species, shevoroshkin said, and one of the  primary characteristics like upright walking and a highly evolved brain that  set humans apart from their cousin primates, the great apes.  he believes by way of a technique called deep reconstruction, he can tap into  the vocabularies of ancient humans, seeking first those elements that exist in  every language in the world -- first and second person pronouns and names for  parts of the body.  such studies produced one of the startling findings in nostratic, he said.  by studying the word for \"eye\" in many languages, soviet researchers were able  to surmise what the word was in nostratic.  \"in english, the word is eye. but in german it is auge, very similar. in old  russian it is oko and in nostratic we believe it was huka.\"  words for nature also lend themselves to historic analysis, he said,  emphasizing that because there was no agriculture before 10,000 years ago there  are no words for domesticated animals other than dog.  nostratic scholars have been able to trace that noun among others, he said.  but even shevoroshkin admits this is an arduous task and acknowledges that many  historical linguists doubt he can delve too deeply into the remote past to find  a language before nostratic.  stanford university linguistic anthropologist joseph greenberg, who has  developed a technique called mass comparisons for analyzing various languages,  is one who questions how well shevoroshkin will do.  greenberg, himself interested in the evolution of the various languages of the  world, prefers not to seek the vocabularies of early humankind but to classify  earth\\'s myriad tongues past and present.  his work produced the classification of african languages in the 1950s, the  groupings generally accepted by linguists today.  greenberg would not call the efforts of shevoroshkin and his co-investigators  futile but allowed the exercise could prove tedious.  \"there\\'s enough to show that all human languages have a common origin,\" said  greenberg. \"i think the really interesting part comes in constructing a family  tree (of languages).\"  but the problem with family trees, shevoroshkin said, is that it is easy to  leave out vast groups of languages and never show how one is related to  another.  \"linguists divide languages into several families such as uralic, indo-european  or afro-asiatic, and so on. they usually say they are not related and if they  are there is no proof.  \"it is our intention to find the proof and to go beyond that,\" shevoroshkin  said of his endeavor.  \"people in this area usually talk about relationships and that makes little  sense to me,\" offered greenberg.  but linguist merritt ruhlen, formerly of stanford, acknowledged recently in the  journal science that shevoroshkin probably is right, that there is an ancient  link tying the world\\'s languages to a common tongue.

       "  'text': 'at its unveiling in mid-october, it was hailed as one of the finest court  buildings in the nation, a gleaming glass-and-granite edifice to justice that  would thrust the san fernando valley into the forefront of courthouse design.  but the new 52-million van nuys municipal courthouse may become the subject of  litigation unless a multimillion-dollar dispute between the contractor and los  angeles county officials is resolved.  originally, plans had called for municipal court personnel to move into the  plush, 11-story, 23-court building, which has its own helipad, 10th-floor  balcony and state-of-the-art security system, in august.  but 4 months later, the new building is still occupied by construction workers.  the municipal court staff continues to use cramped, makeshift quarters in  bungalows and trailers and on a floor of the van nuys superior court building  next door.  locked in negotiations  county officials and sylmar-based tutor-saliba corp., the contractor, are  locked in negotiations over claims that each side is responsible for the delays  and owes the other millions of dollars.  the county on dec. 1 assessed tutor-saliba with late penalties of 3 million  for failing to have the building ready by aug. 15, the completion date  specified in the contract.  the penalties will continue to mount at the rate of 28,000 for each day beyond  the completion date, said thomas v. schriber, the county\\'s chief manager on the  courthouse project. the total by the end of december was 3.8 million, county  officials said.  such penalties are standard in construction projects and were spelled out in  the 1985 contract between the county and tutor-saliba, the low bidder for the  project, schriber said.  the penalties represent the cost to the county of not being able to occupy the  building, he said. for instance, the county must keep inspectors and project  managers at the site, lease space elsewhere and pay other costs because the new  building is not yet open, schriber said.  charges contested  tutor-saliba is contesting the extra charges and accuses the county of causing  the delays. tutor-saliba has filed a claim seeking 1.7 million from the county  for costs that the company says it has incurred because of the delays.  \"on numerous occasions over the past 8 months, this office has advised your  firm . . . of our serious concern over your firm\\'s lack of progress on  completing this project,\" schriber wrote in a dec. 1 letter to tutor-saliba.  schriber\\'s letter said work was not complete on courthouse communications and  elevator systems, nor on mechanical, fire, safety and electrical systems.  it cited the need to replace damaged glass windows, carpets and doors that were  not inspected for fire safety.  \"to our view, the contractor is not performing as well as we would like,\" said  jim abbott, senior deputy director of the county facilities management  department. \"it\\'s fair to say the quality of the work is fine it\\'s just that  it\\'s taking longer to get the work done than we feel it should have.  \"once the courthouse dedication was held,\" abbott said, tutor-saliba \"lost  their concentration on the job.\"  president blames county  ronald n. tutor, tutor-saliba\\'s president, scoffed at the charges and accused  the county of \"trying to cover up their own inadequacies\" by blaming the  contractor for delays.  \"that\\'s a bunch of nonsense. the job is being finished up in spite of the  county, not because of it,\" tutor said. \"the county couldn\\'t build a building  on time if it tried.  \"they know they don\\'t have a prayer in hell of collecting any part\" of the  penalty fees, he added.  tutor said the project has taken longer than scheduled because the county has  repeatedly changed specifications, a charge that abbott denies. tutor claims  that the company is entitled to more time to complete the project without late  penalties because the county has required so many changes.  the delays are inconveniencing municipal court personnel in van nuys, said  aviva k. bobb, the court\\'s presiding judge.  \"we are very concerned by the 6-month delay in occupying the building. we are  anxious to move in as soon as possible,\" bobb said. \"the major hardship has  been that the court is spread all over the block. . . . it causes a lot of  delays, inefficiencies.\"  the county has also had to delay plans to renovate the superior court building  and to open juvenile courts in bungalows now occupied by municipal courtrooms.  the latest tentative plans call for the county to occupy the courthouse in  mid-january and open it to the public in mid-february, said peggy shuttleworth,  valley division chief of the los angeles municipal court.  the building still has to pass inspection by county employees and state fire  marshals, abbott said. it has failed several preliminary fire inspections in  part because doors were not properly fitted and certified as fire-resistant, he  said.  the county is trying to resolve the problems through negotiations with the  company\\'s top management, abbott said. if negotiations break down, a lawsuit is  one of several options that would be considered, he said.  if tutor-saliba fails to finish the job, schriber said, the county would  suspend the firm\\'s contract and have the work done elsewhere.  the building was formally dedicated oct. 14 at a ceremony attended by more than  500 people, including county and court officials, politicians and state supreme  court chief justice malcolm lucas.  graffiti-resistant interior  the new courthouse features a graffiti-resistant interior electronic message  boards, similar to those used at ballparks, to provide information on court  services, and a specially designed, high-security courtroom featuring a  bulletproof glass shield to separate spectators from trial participants. the  court\\'s advanced security system features metal detectors, baggage x-ray  machines and closed-circuit cameras in public hallways and high-volume  courtrooms as well as custody areas.  the courthouse was funded by the sale of public bonds and by the robbins  construction fund, which adds a penalty assessment to traffic and parking  tickets, said jerry orland, head of the project management division of the  facilities management department.  it is not the first time that tutor-saliba has been accused of foot-dragging on  a county courthouse project. the contractor is building a 19-million los  angeles municipal courthouse in cerritos, which is 6 months behind schedule and  has engendered similar charges and countercharges, orland said.  \"we\\'re in the same boat there,\" orland said.  tutor-saliba is one of the largest general contractors in california, ranking  70th nationwide in 1987 with 305.3 million in contract awards, according to  engineering news-record, a trade publication.  tutor-saliba was awarded an 18.3-million contract by the state department of  transportation to widen a 2-mile stretch of the ventura freeway from valley  circle boulevard to white oak avenue.  built airport terminal  the company built the 125-million tom bradley international terminal at los  angeles international airport and is doing 124 million worth of work on the  metro rail subway project in los angeles.  many of the items cited in the county\\'s dec. 1 letter have since been fixed,  but some problems remain, officials said.  on a recent tour of the courthouse, county inspectors pointed out such defects  as seams and discolorations on carpets, scratches on glass windows and walls  that needed touch-up paint. other problems included double doors that must be  replaced because they were too narrow to lock and wheelchair lifts that failed  to function during a recent inspection.  \"at this point, a lot of the changes are just cosmetic stuff and 98% of the  work is already done,\" said mike mcneil, county building inspector. \"but when  you\\'re talking about a 52-million building, that 2% adds up to a lot of little  things left to be done.\"  '},\n",

appears to have discouraged several other  potentially strong candidates from entering the race. the four candidates who  decided to run against tucker are considered unlikely to raise enough money to  compete with brown\\'s resources.  little-known candidate  in interviews, many elected officials and others in inglewood -- the political  heart of the district -- say they know little about tucker. the other  candidates in the race plan to exploit the voters\\' lack of familiarity with  tucker.  \"why hasn\\'t he made himself known?\" asks candidate rod wright, a veteran  political consultant. \"you don\\'t say, \\'my father did this and this, so vote for  me.\\' that\\'s not the way it works in america.\"  tucker acknowledges that he has kept a low profile in the district. while his  brother-in-law, john gibbs, served as the assemblyman\\'s legislative aide in the  50th district, tucker worked five years as an aide to mid-wilshire assemblyman  mike roos, the assembly speaker pro tem, before going to work for assemblywoman  gwen moore (d-los angeles) in the neighboring 49th district eight months ago.  \"i haven\\'t spent as much time in the (50th) district as i would have liked,\"  tucker said. \"but i am known in the district. i know the players.\"  the heir apparent is 34, a tall, husky, bearded man with glasses. in an  interview last week, he seemed comfortable with his new role in the limelight.  he talked freely about the issue that may dominate the abbreviated campaign:  himself.  \"if they spend all their time making me an issue, fine,\" he said. \"i\\'ll be  talking about the real issues: health, crime, airport noise.\"  called brown\\'s puppet  of his critics and rival candidates -- who dismiss him as a puppet of brown  whose only credential is his name -- tucker said:  \"they\\'re discounting what i\\'ve done for the past six years, who i know, and how  the real world works. it\\'s sour grapes.\"  asserting that most people in politics have a mentor, he added: \"they have to  realize the nature of politics and remember how they got where they are.\"  rival candidate lois hill-hale, an inglewood school board member and former  aide to state sen. diane watson (d-los angeles), said voters will resent  brown\\'s \"big boss\" tactics. she said she has never encountered tucker during 10  years of political work in sacramento and in the 50th district. she said many  voters do not know that the elder tucker has died, and she predicted that her  opponent would exploit that confusion.  \"i think he\\'s going to keep as low a profile as possible and hope that as many  as people as possible will not find out that his father has passed,\" she said.  tucker responded: \"a lot of people have told me, don\\'t use \\'junior\\' on your  name, don\\'t change the color of your father\\'s campaign signs, don\\'t use your  picture on literature. but i\\'m not trying to fool anybody. i\\'ll always be  junior.\"  follow father\\'s agenda  tucker promises to carry on his father\\'s policies, particularly the careful  attention to constituents that was the foundation of the assemblyman\\'s  strength, along with big war chests financed by the health industry and labor.  tucker says his legislative office will provide \"one-stop\" service for  constituents who need help. he says his differences with his father are largely  a matter of style, though he considers himself slightly more conservative on  issues such as crime.  \"he favored capital punishment, but i\\'d be more likely to use it,\" he said. \"i  believe it\\'s a deterrent, and i believe it\\'s cheaper to throw the switch than  to pay to keep someone in jail.\"  tucker\\'s upbringing was steeped in politics. his family was known as \"the  tucker army\" because of their involvement in the career of their father, who  was appointed inglewood\\'s first black councilman in 1972, was elected to the  assembly two years later and eventually became health committee chairman.  as the third of five children and the only son of a \"very strong\" father,  tucker says he was restless and resisted his father\\'s pressure to follow a  rapid career path. instead, he attended several colleges, finally earning a  bachelor\\'s degree in history from cal state dominguez hills in 1980. he also  worked in construction for pacific telephone.  \"i wanted to see what was out there,\" tucker said. \"i liked climbing poles and  filling manholes. it gave me a different perspective on life. my father didn\\'t  like it, but he knew i\\'d eventually get tired of getting wet and dirty.\"  tucker, who is married and has two children, entered politics in 1983 as a  legislative assistant based in roos\\' 46th district field office. he acted as a  liaison with community groups on several projects, according to people who  worked with him, including a 1986 bill (ab 2700) to toughen penalties on  apartment owners who did not cooperate with police against drug-dealing  tenants. he also worked on preparing a 1987 bill (ab 1700) that provided  incentives to the los angeles unified school district to build multistory  school buildings rather than tear down neighboring homes.  \"it gives the school board money to build more creatively on less land,\" tucker  said. \"it suppresses the need of cutting further into housing stock.\"  praised effort  a legislative staffer who knows tucker\\'s work praised his efforts on that bill.  \"the school district was happy and the homeowners were happy,\" the staffer  said. \"i\\'d give curtis an \\'a\\' on that one.\"  the staffer described tucker as intelligent and capable. but tucker\\'s work  sometimes suffered because of absenteeism and a seeming lack of motivation, the  staffer said: \"there was some concern about the quality of his work. . . . i  think he has the chance to be an above-average assembly member. he has the  intellect. the question is, does he have the drive, the fire in the belly?\"  tucker responded: \"i would say that\\'s one person\\'s opinion. everyone is not  going to thrilled with your performance. that goes without saying.\"  on the other hand, george allen, executive director of the wilshire chamber of  commerce on which tucker served as roos\\' representative, had nothing but  praise.  \"he\\'s an outstanding young man and a hard worker,\" allen said. \"i highly  recommend him.\"  positioning for future  whatever tucker\\'s early doubts about a future in politics, he said his move  this year to assemblywoman moore\\'s office was calculated to bring him closer to  the 50th district and position him for the future.  asked why his father did not hire him as an aide, tucker said they both  believed it was better they did not work in the same office for both political  and personal reasons.  \"the press would have had a field day with it,\" he said. \"one family member  shouldn\\'t work directly for another.\"  but the family had a synchronized political agenda, tucker said. having turned  70, assemblyman tucker intended his 1988-90 term to be his last in 1990, the  plan was for curtis jr. to take center stage.  \"my father always wanted to be mayor of inglewood,\" tucker said. \"he would have  run for mayor, and i would have run for assembly in 1990.\"  but the elder tucker\\'s death has \"speeded up the process tremendously,\" he  said.  tucker\\'s sudden emergence appears to have frustrated the ambitions of potential  rivals, such as inglewood mayor edward vincent and councilman daniel tabor,  both of whom have carefully built their careers toward a run for the assembly.  both have said tucker is not entitled to the seat simply because of his name.  \\'has he paid his dues?\\'  \"the opportunity to select among a qualified field of candidates has been  eliminated,\" tabor said. alluding to the predominantly black voter base in the  district, he added: \"the real question is, how well does the african-american  community manage the process of preparing leaders for the future? you tell  people to go out and pay dues. has he paid his dues?\"  tucker says he has.  \"there is no prerequisite course for being a member of the assembly,\" he said.  \"there should be a need to serve and a desire to do a good job.\"  tucker hopes to win election feb. 7 by capturing more than 50% of the vote,  thus avoiding an april 11 runoff against mike davis, the only republican  running. tucker says his campaign plans to spend between 100,000 and 150,000  on the race and will use an adviser from brown\\'s sacramento operation, as well  as political consultant parke skelton, who ran the elder tucker\\'s last  campaign.  if elected, tucker said he will follow his father\\'s lead in giving special  attention to health matters he hopes to work on a comprehensive package of  health-care legislation being prepared by brown that will be named after the  elder tucker. he also said that although his father had a mild aversion to  publicity, especially television, he plans to have a higher profile and use the  media to report on what he is doing in sacramento.  tucker\\'s opponents look forward to confronting him on equal footing at debates  scheduled for next month. they say tucker\\'s advantage will crumble when voters  compare the candidates in person.  but frank lewis, an inglewood dentist and longtime tucker ally, said tucker  will live up to his father\\'s legacy.  \"he\\'s quiet,\" lewis said. \"but he knows politics. he\\'s well-versed. people are  going to be surprised.\"  tucker said: \"so many people who go into politics have a puffed up sense of  self-worth. my father never took himself seriously. . . . and i\\'m still the  same person who hung off telephone poles. i have no illusions about who i am.\"  tucker on record  \"i haven\\'t spent as much time in the (50th) district as i would have liked, but  i am known in the district. i know the players.\"  \"(my critics) are discounting what i\\'ve done for the past six years, who i  know, and how the real world works. it\\'s sour grapes.\"  \"a lot of people have told me, don\\'t use \\'junior\\' on your name, don\\'t change  the color

       "  'text': 'hello 1989, i thought you\\'d never get here.  1988? i thought you\\'d never leave.  in a way, it was the year of the loser. in order, they were:  1. ben johnson -- oh, rare, ben johnson. how can anyone lose more devastatingly  than at the very hour of achieving his life\\'s ambition? when it all falls to  ashes just after all one\\'s dreams are realized, when the world is at his feet,  when what you have worked for, strived for, dreamed of all your life has just  come true -- and someone comes in and tells you it\\'s all been a mistake. ben  had just won the olympic gold medal, set the world record and identified  himself as the greatest sprinter of all time when suddenly a man in a white lab  coat turns it to nightmare. when they stripped jim thorpe of his medals, he  became an object of pity. ben johnson became an object of scorn. he lost more  than a medal. he lost respect. ben makes loser-of-the-year unanimously.  2. dave stieb -- would you classify as a loser a pitcher who lost a no-hitter  with two-out in the bottom on the ninth to a bad-hop single through the  infield? ok, how about a pitcher who lost two no-hitters in a row that way?  that, my friends, is major-league losing. just a twist here and you\\'re looking  at the second guy in major-league history to pitch back-to-back no- hitters.  you are looking at johnny vander meer ii. you are looking at a guy who will  become the answer to a trivia question through 2000 a.d. alas! the ball hopped.  3. pat dye -- how do you become a loser-of-the-year when you have the ball on  your opponents\\' 13-yard line, 3 points behind, with 4 seconds left to play?  right! you kick a field goal. a losers\\' play. you go for the tie. you strike  your colors, fold your hand, cry uncle. it\\'s what auburn coach pat dye did in  last year\\'s sugar bowl against syracuse. whatever happened to \"winning isn\\'t  everything, it\\'s the only thing?\" whatever became of fight, fight, fight?  stonewall jackson would never understand. neither would george gipp. woody  hayes would hit somebody.  4. davey johnson -- how would you like to be in game 7 of the playoff series  for the national league pennant and have a pitcher on your staff who is known  as \"dr.k,\" who has struck out more than 1,000 batters, won 18 games in the  season and is only 23 years old. he is on the bench with 3 days rest. the  opposition is starting its best pitcher who has had only 3 days rest and has  already pitched 3 times in the series. nevertheless, manager davey johnson  doesn\\'t start dwight gooden in the most important game of the season. the mets  manager starts ron darling with predictable results. he doesn\\'t save gooden  anyway. dwight gets in the game with the score 6-0 and the pennant gone. in the  other dugout, manager tom lasorda plays the ace -- orel hershiser. davey  johnson makes loser-of-the-year by acclamation, the pinup boy for every  second-guesser east of the tehachapis.  5. dennis eckersley -- how would you like to be the best relief pitcher in the  american league with a league-leading 45 saves, an era of 2.35, a record of  having only walked 11 batsmen all year and a record of having finished 53 of  the 60 games you appeared -- and in the ninth inning of the first world series  game, you are breezing along with a 4-3 lead and have just retired the first  two batters to face you, one by strikeout, the other by weak grounder. you need  an out to, maybe, just clinch the whole world series when up comes this batter  who has hit just .196 all year with no great reputation for power (he has hit 2  home runs and has 17 runs-batted-in). he strikes out a lot (once every 4 1/2  times at-bat).  this is not babe ruth but you, you, unaccountably, begin to pitch to him as if  he were. the next thing you know, you have just walked mike davis and put the  tying run on first base. but, never mind. get a load of the guy who\\'s coming up  to pinch-hit. he looks like a guy leaving a train wreck. he can hardly walk. he  winces just lifting the bat. he\\'s only going to tap the ball into play some  place and hope for a big break. this is the only at-bat he\\'ll get in the whole  series and he doesn\\'t look as if he can handle even this. you get two quick  strikes on this refugee from the disabled list and this looks like a mismatch.  the chances are good he couldn\\'t get around on a medium-good fastball if you  sent it up there with stamps on it. so, for some reasons best known to the  gremlins of baseball, you decide to try what you call a \"backdoor slider\" on  him. now, the slider is the pitch the late fresco thompson used to say was  going to put * lot of .270 hitters in the hall of fame. it was, he said, the  pitch that let maris break babe ruth\\'s home-run record.  it has been variously described as the \"nickel curve,\" the \"downtown pitch,\"  and, when it doesn\\'t work, as \"the slop slider.\" this one you let go of is all  three. at the bat, kirk gibson can\\'t believe his good luck. his eyes get big,  his groin doesn\\'t hurt any more. he dreams of pitches like this. as joe  garagiola would say, \"you couldn\\'t order a better one from room service.\"  gibson swings. not hard, just about like a guy lofting a 9-iron to a trapped  green. it is out of the lot the minute it leaves the bat. it is one of the  historic home runs of baseball history. it wins, to all intents and purposes,  the world series. it is a pitch dennis eckersley probably wanted to run after  and retrieve the minute he let go of it. to call time. pray for an earthquake.  anything to get that ball back in his glove before it goes into the right-field  seats.  that pitch is one of the great losers of 1988. it is a game-loser and a  series-loser. they don\\'t get any worse than that.  john mcenroe-who?

       "  'text': 'you just couldn\\'t see the chicago bears beating the philadelphia eagles  saturday in their national football conference semifinal playoff game.  oh, the bears won, 20-12. you just couldn\\'t see it.  or much of anything else on a day when fog, rolling in off lake michigan,  severely hampered visibility at soldier field. veterans in the press box said  it was the worst they\\'d seen, or rather not seen, at this stadium in half a  century.  who knows? when they review the film, they may yet discover philadelphia won.  mike ditka vs. buddy ryan? this was more like sherlock holmes vs. professor  moriarty.  but in the end, as is often the case at soldier field, blue sky or no sky, the  game came down to the bear defensive unit. ranked no. 2 in the national  football league, it lived up to its ranking, intercepting 3 randall cunningham  passes and holding the eagles to 52 yards rushing.  and the eagles helped out by constantly breaking down offensively. penalties,  dropped passes, missed opportunities -- philadelphia was guilty of all that as  it failed to reach the end zone despite the fact that cunningham completed 27  of 54 passes for 407 yards.  at times, the players couldn\\'t even see the end zone.  \"what i could see was about 20 yards downfield,\" cunningham said. \"if you take  your 10-yard dropback, you could see only about 15 yards.  \"we had to change to our short routes. they knew that. but let me say first, we  beat ourselves.\"  and much to the delight of the crowd of 65,534. or at least that portion of the  crowd that could see what was going on. pity the poor fan who shelled out 30  to sit in a seat and watch the blurry figures fade in and out of the mist. kind  of like paying for a big fight to be beamed into your living room only to have  the picture go out on your television set.  in the press box, the media were reduced to listening to reports from the field  or watching monitors.  how often do you hear the public address announcer say, \"there\\'s word of a flag  on the field.\"  never mind instant replay. saturday\\'s game may begin a debate over the use of  radar.  it was a great day for getting away with holding, 12 men on the field or the  hidden-ball trick.  it would have been a great afternoon for legendary bear runner red grange,  known as the galloping ghost.  so much for the home-field advantage. the fans can\\'t cheer for what they can  only hear.  strangely enough, the day began with a bright blue sky and the temperature in  the 30s.  it was under those conditions that the bears took an early lead.  quarterback mike tomczak, starting his first nfl playoff game, made his first  completion a memorable one, connecting with dennis mckinnon on a 64-yard  touchdown pass play in the first quarter.  \"there was a problem with the coverage, and i think we might have had the right  play called,\" tomczak said. (receiver glen) kozlowski cut underneath, and i  think the corner (roynell young) was starting to move inside, apparently  thinking dennis was also going inside. dennis just headed upfield and had the  corner beat. it was a great fake on dennis\\' part.\"  it also helped that safety andre waters, the only man with a shot at mckinnon,  fell down.  he got up after mckinnon had caught the ball at the philadelphia 40 and had a  shot at the bear receiver but missed the tackle, leaving mckinnon to celebrate  the last 15 yards.  in all, tomczak completed 10 of 20 for 172 yards before he was forced out in  the third quarter on a play in which he had his third interception, this one to  terry hoage.  reggie white hit tomczak, reinjuring the left shoulder that tomczak had  separated several weeks ago.  jim mcmahon, originally forced to the sideline with a twisted knee and then  kept there by tomczak\\'s success as a starter, finished the game.  ditka, the bear coach, said he would wait to see how severe tomczak\\'s injury is  before naming a starter for next week\\'s nfc championship game, where the bears  will play host to the winner of today\\'s minnesota vikings-san francisco 49ers  game.  after giving up the bomb to mckinnon, the eagles responded with their own  aerial attack.  remember, the sun was still out at this point, and the end zone was clearly in  sight.  but beyond reach.  on their first drive after the touchdown, the eagles wound up with nothing when  luis zendejas missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt.  philadelphia got the ball back on the first play of the bears\\' next drive on  seth joyner\\'s interception.  then came one of the eagles\\' most frustrating drives of the season, exceeded  only by its next drive.  more about that later.  taking over at the chicago 30, philadelphia drove to the 9, where cunningham  hit cris carter with a pass in the end zone.  the apparent touchdown was called back because of illegal motion by running  back anthony toney.  so cunningham came right back and fired it into the end zone again. this time,  4 men touched the ball. defenders dave duerson and mike richardson got a hand  on it. carter also got a piece, batting the ball into the arms of fellow  receiver mike quick.  touchdown at last?  not quite. again a penalty. again toney. this time holding.  so the eagles settled for zendejas\\' 42-yard field goal. in all, he would kick  4, the others coming from 29, 30 and 35 yards.  the eagles\\' frustration, however, was just beginning.  on their next drive, they reached the chicago 4, where they faced a fourth and  1.  cunningham kept the ball on a draw and was hit at the line by dante jones.  the officials brought out the chains. and measured. and checked. and checked  again.  the verdict?  short by an inch.  on their next drive, the eagles again apparently had a touchdown in their  grasp. keith jackson was wide open in the end zone, but he jumped too soon for  cunningham\\'s perfect pass and dropped it.  chicago took the ensuing kickoff and drove to another touchdown, neal anderson  going in from the eagle 4 off left tackle.  by now the fog rolled in, and the eagles were ready to roll out of postseason  play.  the bears added 6 points on kevin butler\\'s field goals of 46 and 27 yards.  when it was over, eagle coach buddy ryan, a former assistant at chicago, where  he had a long-running feud with ditka, was asked if he had shaken hands with  his former head coach.  \"what,\" he asked, \"was there to shake about?\"  nfc playoff notes  the chicago interceptions were by mickey pruitt, vestee jackson and maurice  douglass. . . . keith jackson, despite his drop, had a big day receiving with 7  catches for 142 yards. running back keith byars made 9 catches for 103 yards.  byars was philadelphia\\'s leading ballcarrier with 34 yards in 7 carries. . . .  thomas sanders led chicago with 94 yards rushing, 58 coming on a second-quarter  run.

       "  'text': 'prior to this season, geoff courtnall, the washington capitals\\' hard-hitting,  high-scoring left wing was mainly used as a checker and a guy who would give up  his body to go into the boards and create havoc with opposing players. if he  scored, all well and good, but his main job was disturbing the other team\\'s  attack.  this year all of that has changed and courtnall is the leading scorer on the  capitals and one of the driving offensive forces in the team\\'s surge for first  place in the patrick division of the national hockey league.  \"my job in the past was to go after the other guy,\" said courtnall, who has 19  goals and 19 assists entering tuesday night\\'s game at the capital centre at  landover, md., against the philadelphia flyers. \"my concern was not scoring,  but stirring things up. i like it much better this year. i like being involved  in the scoring. i always had a good shot and i always believed i could score,  but that wasn\\'t my primary role. i did what i was supposed to do.\"  in his previous five seasons with the boston bruins, courtnall, 6-feet-1,  195-pound, a native of victoria, british columbia, scored 82 goals and handed  out 85 assists in 271 games. last season, one which he split between boston and  edmonton, was his best scoring year with 36 goals and 30 assists. barring  serious injury, he should easily surpass both figures this season.  the capitals acquired courtnall, 26, from edmonton for greg adams last july.  \"geoff courtnall has added a new dimension to our power play and has been our  most consistent scorer,\" said capitals coach bryan murray. \"he is a very aware  hockey player. he sees so much of the ice. not only is he a very adept passer,  but he has a tremendous shot. he really has a gun as he has demonstrated on  many occasions this season. he has been a very welcome addition to our hockey  club.\"  courtnall, whose twin brother russ plays for the montreal canadiens, leads the  capitals in home scoring with 12 goals and 10 assists and had the second  longest scoring streak in team history when he scored in 15 consecutive games  earlier this season. he leads the team in shots with 120 and collected his  200th national hockey league point dec. 7 against the new jersey devils. he  also has nine power-play goals.  murray, in his eighth season with washington, achieved his 300th nhl coaching  victory dec. 15. he has coached 581 games and is tied with tommy ivan for 16th  on the all-time victory list. ivan coached detroit and chicago from 1947 until  1958.  voting for the teams that will compete in the 40th nhl all-star game feb. 7 in  edmonton, alberta, will end sunday. voting began in november.  the wales conference all-stars will be coached by terry o\\'reilly of the boston  bruins and the campbell conference team will be coached by glen sather of the  edmonton oilers. norm ullman and bruce macgregor, both former nhl players, have  been named honorary captains for the game.  hartford wing sylvain turgeon underwent surgery on a separated left shoulder  thursday and will be sidelined for three months. the whalers recalled dallas  gaume from binghamton of the american hockey league to replace him.  where are they now? reggie leach, who scored the most goals in a season (61 in  1976) for the philadelphia flyers and played 13 seasons with the flyers,  boston, california and detroit. he won the conn smythe trophy in 1976 when the  flyers won the stanley cup by beating montreal, 4-0. he scored 666 points in  934 games, including 381 goals. leach owns sports lawn service in new jersey.  hockey fans in pittsburgh have missed wayne gretzky two years in a row. last  season, when he was with edmonton, he missed the oilers\\' only game in  pittsburgh because of an injury, and this season he missed the kings\\' only game  in pittsburgh because of his grandmother\\'s funeral. gretzky said that his  grandmother, mary gretzky, used to sit in a chair and play goalie for him when  he practiced his shooting.  petr klima of the detroit red wings has been going through some highs and lows  lately. last week, he went to the airport to meet his parents, josef and kveta  klima, for a reunion. he had not seen them since he defected from  czechoslovakia in august 1985. the next day, he was in court, pleading guilty  to a drunken driving charge and leaving an accident scene. it was his second  conviction.

       "  'text': 'consider it a positive development in international relations that the soviets  have become frequent tourists. familiarity has diluted contempt. alas, it also  has dulled the expectations of such meetings.  when mikhail gorbachev stepped out of a limousine to shake hands with u.s.  citizens during his recent visit, he followed the inclination of his nation\\'s  athletes. for more than a decade, they have enjoyed north american hospitality  in increasing numbers. until the advent of glasnost, they just lacked the  freedom of expression.  now there is as much interest, if not more, in what they say as in the way they  play. when the central red army team meets the new york islanders at nassau  coliseum in uniondale, n.y., thursday night, the focus will be on defenseman  vyatcheslav fetisov, not only because he may be the best in the world at what  he does, but also because he has made public his frustration in being prevented  from joining the new jersey devils. \"if it weren\\'t for gorbachev,\" he said  wednesday, \"this (discussion) would be impossible.\"  but the sports exchanges between east and west preceded the improved dialogue  between government officials. this marks the seventh tour of nhl rinks by one  or more soviet clubs in the last 13 years, and that doesn\\'t include such  special events as the challenge cup, the canada cup or the rendez-vous \\'87  series. and hockey is merely the tip of the iceberg.  this year, soviet teams have competed in basketball, volleyball, boxing,  wrestling and, yes, even baseball on u.s. soil. the u.s.s.r. has sent us  wrestlers and weightlifters, among others, in the past. a decade ago, it even  entered a team in world team tennis. the team wasn\\'t very good, but it was the  only one in the league that managed to turn a profit.  and now we have in our midst the red army team and dynamo riga team, which  played the second game on a western swing wednesday night in edmonton, alberta.  the nhl is billing it as a super series, but it\\'s more superfluous than  anything. we have passed the point where either side has much to prove in terms  of superiority.  that wasn\\'t the case in 1972, of course. the soviets were regarded as amateurs  (in the most derisive sense of the word) by the canadian hockey establishment  when the nhl agreed to make available its seasoned pros in an eight-game hockey  summit.  officials laughed at the soviets\\' equipment before the first game at the  montreal forum, and at least one newspaper columnist promised to eat his words  if team canada lost as much as one game.  \"it was our first training camp,\" islanders president bill torrey recalled  wednesday. \"we watched the game at the beautiful holiday inn in peterborough  (ontario). we went up 2-0 and everyone was saying this is going to be a piece  of cake.\"  but the soviets stormed back to win the first game in a rout, and the nhl\\'s  best didn\\'t clinch a 4-3-1 series victory until the final minute of the final  game, played in moscow. \"that was my last year of midgets,\" said bryan  trottier, then a 16-year-old in rural saskatchewan. \"i remember the last game  was on at 11 o\\'clock. the whole school shut down and we all went to the  auditorium to watch it on television.\"  the drama, intensified by the belief that the teams were upholding a way of  life, was riveting. and the lack of previous contact between the groups led to  suspicion. there was the story of wayne cashman, who, convinced his hotel room  in moscow was bugged, located a foreign-looking object underneath the carpet  and proceeded to unscrew it, sending a chandelier in the room below toppling to  the floor.  from a sporting standpoint, the cold war between east and west ended on the ice  in moscow. the world hockey association sent a team of all-stars to moscow two  years later and, in 1976, the soviets sent two club teams to tour north  america.  on the evening before the red army made its initial appearance at the coliseum  almost 13 years ago, islanders owner roy boe hosted a reception for the  visitors. \"if you want plenty of beer or vodka,\" he said, \"we\\'ll do what we can  to help.\"  north american teams have since gone beyond providing alcohol for the visitors.  last summer, the portland trail blazers of the national basketball association  worked to rehabilitate the achilles injury that had sidelined soviet center  arvidas sabonis. he returned from the injury in time to lead his country to an  upset of the u.s. team in the olympics.  such consideration didn\\'t make everyone in the united states happy. john  thompson, for one, was critical of americans giving aid to the enemy even  before the team he coached was ambushed in seoul, south korea. but, as the  trail blazers explained, they were only protecting their own investment. they  had drafted sabonis and were hopeful that he would be permitted to wear a  portland uniform after the olympics.  they\\'re still waiting, as are the devils for fetisov. many on both sides  believe it\\'s inevitable that individual soviet athletes will be permitted to  play for professional teams in north america, further blurring the distinctions  in lifestyle that once gave such bite to games between the east and west.  \"in the actual situation of world extension, of the relationship between our  countries,\" soviet forward igor larionov said wednesday through an interpreter,  \"it\\'s a good step.\" larionov has been drafted by the vancouver canucks. is he  interested in playing here? \"why not?\" he replied, smiling.  perhaps some day there will be soviets sprinkled throughout the nhl, the nba  and other professional leagues. and perhaps at such a time the presence of even  the leader of the u.s.s.r. won\\'t halt traffic in new york.

       "  'text': 'the houston oilers are coming, the houston oilers are coming.  america\\'s incorrigibles are on the road again, their reputations preceding  them, threatening another hometown darling. today it\\'s the buffalo bills,  playing their first playoff game at home in 22 years before their wild, crazy,  longest-suffering, ready-to-party-hearty fans.  the bills are 3 1/2-point favorites, although a look at their recent record  makes you wonder.  meet the paper bills?  buffalo had the league\\'s best record -- 11-1 -- until losing 3 of its last 4.  the bills were outrushed in the losses, 232 to 110 yards, 110-39 and 53-19, an  ominous sign for a conservative team. also, shane conlan, the inside linebacker  who was a key to their rushing defense until he missed all of the late losses,  is expected to sit out again quarterback jim kelly is under increasing fire,  and some of it is coming from a teammate.  that\\'s halfback robb riddick, who recently told a tv station in rochester,  n.y., \"i just don\\'t feel jim is doing the job he is being paid to do.\"  riddick was upset that the backs weren\\'t being thrown enough passes, although  you have to wonder which games he has been watching. more than one-third of  kelly\\'s completions have gone to his backs.  coach marv levy was upset with the timing of the remarks and said there was  nothing to it.  \"robb came back and called jim kelly that night,\" levy said. \"he told him the  remarks came out much different than he\\'d expected and apologized for whatever  embarrassment there was.  \"jim said, \\'forget it, i know how these things happen, we\\'ve got more important  things to deal with than that.\\' \"  that kelly is a brick, isn\\'t he?  of course, he may have been a tiny bit more perturbed than levy said he was.  kelly is generally considered one of the game\\'s best young quarterbacks, has  just made the pro bowl over such candidates as dan marino and john elway . . .  and has been getting ripped in letters to the editor and on radio talk shows by  the arch-supportive bills faithful. there\\'s a reason for it too -- try 15  touchdown passes against 17 interceptions, compared to the 41-28 ratio he  compiled in his first 2 seasons.  irony: as he starts to get his greatest praise since entering the league, he\\'s  drawing his most heat, too.  bottom line: he\\'s getting angry about it.  \"i\\'m so tired of hearing about negative things,\" he said last week, when the  riddick question came up.  but hadn\\'t riddick called to apologize, etc.?  \"yeah,\" said kelly, without enthusiasm, \"he called.\"  on the other hand, the bills still have bruce smith (11 sacks in 12 games),  cornelius bennett (9 1/2), fred smerlas and the rest of that rock-ribbed  defense that got them here. the oilers, renowned, warm-weather warriors, will  face a more forbidding day than they got last week at cleveland.  the bills are already braced for all of those oiler tough-guy tactics, vowing  not to retaliate, as the browns\\' ernest byner did, earning back-to-back  roughing penalties and killing a drive. however, you might conclude that the  oilers\\' raider-type reputation is already working for them: the bills are  spending all this time worrying about what the oilers will do and how they\\'ll  handle it.  actually, the oilers have been on their best behavior.  jerry glanville, fresh from eliminating the browns and bringing down their  coaching staff, took it easy on buffalo, where he was an assistant 1 season. he  said nothing bad about the town, which has provided fertile material for so  many comedians, except to remark that he was leaving tickets for the late jay  silverheels, the local actor who used to play tonto.  for a change, the most hated oiler isn\\'t their macho little coach but general  manager ladd herzeg. it was herzeg who, in 1987, was accused of having made an,  uh, impolite gesture during an argument at the team\\'s hotel with members of a  wedding party.  assault charges were filed against herzeg but dropped by a buffalo judge, on  the condition that herzeg stays out of local trouble.  if those wedding receptions quit hassling him, he\\'ll be fine.  afc playoff notes  come back, shane: the bills sent shane conlan to birmingham, ala., last week to  have dr. james andrews look at his injured arch which isn\\'t responding to rest  or therapy. said coach marv levy: \"we\\'re not counting on him, but we haven\\'t  counted him out.\" . . . classic confrontation: houston\\'s offensive line, with  its three, high no. 1 picks (pro bowl guards bruce matthews and mike munchak,  and tackle dean steinkuhler) against the bills\\' defensive front, which has four  no. 1s (pro bowl players bruce smith, cornelius bennett, conlan and art still)  and two no. 2s (pro bowl player fred smerlas and darryl talley). . . . key  matchup, or battle of the bruces: oiler left tackle bruce davis, the former  raider, vs. bill right end bruce smith, second only to the eagles\\' reggie white  in potential to disable an entire offense by himself. smerlas, the colorful  nose tackle, faces center jay pennison, who the raiders considered the oiler  line\\'s weak link. of course, the raiders thought smerlas was a hype, too. . . .  the bills are 11-1 when they have rushed for more than 100 yards. however, the  underrated oiler defense was no. 1 in the american football conference against  the run. . . . levy, on defensing the oilers: \"they\\'re not one dimensional.  there\\'s no one thing to stop. we can\\'t say something like, \\'stop eric dickerson  and you\\'ll stop the colts. it\\'s not that simple. they have a superior offensive  line, great receivers, a fine quarterback (warren moon) who gets better all the  time and that tremendous stable of runners.\"  ',\n",

       "  'text': 'one of wayne duke\\'s most prized possessions is the clipping from sports  illustrated that pictures him with john wayne at the rose parade. john wayne  sent him the clipping and signed it, \"to wayne duke from duke wayne.\"  wayne duke, commissioner of the big ten, smiles when he tells about that  now-fading momento.  so you see, duke does have some fond memories of the annual trip he has made to  california for the rose bowl every year for the past 18 years. but ask him  about the highlights and lowlights of his new year\\'s day ritual and he gives  that familiar wayne duke grimace.  he had been in town less than 3 hours wednesday and he had already been asked  why the big ten can\\'t win the rose bowl.  since announcing his retirement last summer, a retirement that will become  effective in the upcoming year when a successor is chosen, duke has had plenty  of opportunities to review his tenure as leader of the big ten.  the conference boasts the largest football and basketball attendance in the  country, and that comes from winning a lot of games.  duke was chairman of the ncaa basketball tournament committee that expanded the  field to 64 teams and upped the tv rights so that the tournament now brings in  about 55 million.  duke was on the committee that put together a 103 million tv package between  the big ten and the rose bowl that will run through 1997.  the rose bowl game is truly dear to his heart. duke has always been able to  refer to the game as \"the granddaddy of them all\" without cracking a smile at  the corny sound. he believes it.  it\\'s a traditional matchup, and duke believes that college football should be  more traditional, should match schools and school spirits for the pride and the  memories and the glory, not an abstract no. 1 and no. 2 for a mythical title.  \"you can have a \\'national championship\\' game in phoenix this year, or, from  time to time, in miami, but this game will be sold out year after year after  year,\" duke said.  the rose bowl is his kind of college football.  walter byers, the longtime executive director of the ncaa, now retired, who  strongly influenced duke during his early years in the ncaa office, told the  chicago tribune: \"we both came from the romantic era in sports. emphasis was  placed on values to be learned from the game. you competed because you enjoyed  it.\"  while he can get quite philosophical about the over-emphasis on winning and  losing, even at the level of eighth-grade soccer his grandson plays, duke  cannot deny the impact it has on him to have to see his teams lose.  \"i go in the dressing rooms,\" duke said. \"i try to go to our team\\'s dressing  room after any game i see in the conference. i always go down after the rose  bowl game. and there\\'s a disappointment in there after a loss. people who are  critical of our bowl record, or even people who are critical of the team\\'s  performance that day, don\\'t have to see, first hand, the terrible  disappointment that is felt by the players and the coaches who have put so much  into the game.  \"the guy up in the stands who has been tailgating all day and who thinks he has  all the answers, doesn\\'t have to see what losing does to the players and the  coaches.\"  or what it does to duke, who has come back up to the pressbox looking so  distressed that writers have joked about keeping an eye on him so he doesn\\'t  jump from the roof.  duke tries to keep smiling. \"tom hansen (commissioner of the pacific 10) tells  me i\\'m a very good loser,\" duke said. \"i tell him, that\\'s because i\\'ve had a  lot of practice.\"  but it doesn\\'t get easier.  as he flipped through the pages of his memories, duke could not seem to  separate good times and bad times in southern california from the wins and the  losses.  \"i\\'ll tell you the contrast,\" duke said. \"the first year we were here and  something that happened just last year make a good contrast.\"  the first year duke and his wife, martha, came out for the rose bowl game,  stanford beat michigan. it was after the 1971 season.  for the duke family, it was an emotional time, anyway. he had become big ten  commissioner on sept. 1, 1971, after 8 years as commissioner of the big eight  and 11 years of service in the national collegiate athletic assn. office. they  had just sold their home of 19 years to make the move to chicago.  after all those years of going to miami every holiday season for the orange  bowl, they were in southern california -- where it was raining.  the michigan team was having to practice in bakersfield.  nothing was looking too rosy.  and then, the all-important game. in the final minutes of the game, michigan  got a safety to go ahead of stanford, 12-10. but don bunce, the stanford  quarterback, took stanford down the field and rod garcia kicked a field goal to  beat the wolverines.  \"martha and i had been talking about how the final standings would go if  michigan lost, and we knew that big eight teams were going to be 1-2-3,\" duke  said. \"we\\'d been talking about that for days.  \"well, lawrence welk was grand marshal of the parade that year, and he was at  the tournament house that night for the party. he stood up there and said, \\'a-1  and a-2 and a-3,\\' and martha burst into tears.\"  not a happy memory.  the dukes decided in subsequent years to skip the party at the tournament  house. it was a celebration. often the big ten contingent didn\\'t feel like  celebrating. the dukes would go back to the presidential suite at the pasadena  hilton to spend the evening with big ten guests.  last season, when michigan state beat usc, they again skipped the tournament  house celebration. it wouldn\\'t look right to show up only after a victory.  so the dukes were back in their suite that evening, savoring a victory that,  admittedly, was a \"blue collar win . . . a game we won after usc fumbled, but  we\\'d lost a lot of games that way\" when there was a knock at the door.  \"all the rose bowl officers -- harriman cronk and all the rest -- came to bring  me my rose bowl watch,\" duke said. \"that was a highlight. they left their  celebration to bring that to me, and i appreciated that.\"  there were some points in their long relationship when some of the rose bowl  folks were not too happy with duke, when he sided with the movement to exclude  the exclusivity clause from the rose bowl contract.  some feared that allowing big ten and pac-10 teams to compete in other bowls,  also, would dilute the impact of the rose bowl. duke believed that the rose  bowl, matching the champions of the conferences, would remain as strong as ever  while letting more teams compete would be of benefit to both conferences.  he was right, as usual.  over the last few years, big ten and pac-10 schools have claimed an average of  40% of the total bowl pot of about 50 million.  duke points out that opening opportunities was good for parity in his  conference, good for attendance, good for recruiting.  \"when i had just been named commissioner of the big eight, and i was only 34  years old at the time, one of the first things i faced was the news that the  orange bowl was terminating our exclusive contract,\" duke said. \"they wanted to  be able to invite the top teams, to have a \\'national championship\\' game.  \"sports illustrated wrote that the loss of that contract would be the death  knoll of the big eight. actually, it turned out to be a boon to the big eight.  it opened up vistas for other bowls. we went to the cotton bowl, the sugar bowl  and the orange bowl. it was great for our conference.\"  since the rose bowl changed its policy, and the big ten started to compete in  other bowls in 1976, big ten schools have taken 56 bowl berths.  duke and his wife have been at a bowl game on new year\\'s day for the last 26  years. they might attend a bowl game just for fun next year. or they might not.  if he\\'s not at the rose bowl next year, he says he\\'ll miss it.  \"i\\'ve been to most of the bowl games at one time or another,\" duke said. \"i\\'ve  been to all the major bowls -- orange, cotton, sugar. . . . and this is not to  degrade any of the others. but i think the rose bowl is special.\"  ',\n",

       "  'text': 'this is a proposal for the governor of oklahoma, the honorable henry bellmon.  roll up your sleeves, take a broom from the maintenance shed and, in one quick  motion, sweep out the entire administration of the state university ...  specifically the interim president, athletic director and football coach. not  under the rug, but out the door.  it\\'s particularly distressing that violations of recruiting rules have once  again brought deep embarrassment to the school, its faculty and proud alumni.  the university of oklahoma has been slapped with a three-year probation for  blatant disregard of the ncaa code. too bad.  there\\'s something wrong in the thought process when oklahoma puts such an  emphasis on winning football games that it pays 1,000 to an athlete and  provides an individual scalping service for varsity players so they can  conveniently pocket the ticket money. if the governor isn\\'t ashamed, then he\\'s  not conversant with what\\'s going on in the state that elected him to provide  proper guidance and supervision.  it\\'s personally distressing because we never met a man (or woman) from oklahoma  we didn\\'t like. we once hitch-hiked from tulsa to claremore to visit the will  rogers museum in an effort to learn more about the old rope-spinning,  yarn-telling cowboy philosopher. our interest in oklahoma has been so extensive  that it resulted in the state\\'s officially confirming upon us the title of  \"honorary okie,\" with an actual certificate and button to go with it.  now oklahoma, in a football way, has gone and inflicted injury to itself by  drawing still another suspension. this is the fourth time the football program  has been penalized in as many decades. how much longer is this type of  despicable conduct going to continue?  the violation shows oklahoma has found still another way to disgrace itself.  it\\'s also reminiscent of what the former ou president, speaking facetiously,  once said: \"we\\'re going to build a university the football team can be proud  of.\" humorous or not, it\\'s disgusting that education at oklahoma is besmirched  by what\\'s going on in the hunt for prospects who can block and tackle.  as for coach barry switzer, the ncaa statement declared he \"failed to exercise  supervisory control.\" it\\'s as though he went out to lunch and stayed when the  problems were occurring. the duty to conduct a clean operation belongs to him.  if his assistants and office help were involved in illegal tactics, then he is  the one who should be compelled to pay the penalty.  if it was the military and something such as this happened, then the duty  officer in charge would be brought up on allegations of incompetency and maybe  even stripped of his commission. switzer should be taking the rap for what has  happened. how can he be held blameless?  the governor should ask for his resignation by nightfall and advise him to take  his services to texas a&ampm, houston or smu. the assessment of the charges,  bringing severe discipline, tells the public switzer doesn\\'t know what\\'s going  on in his own shop, or coaching offices. it\\'s time to assess barry\\'s value to  oklahoma.  it would be within the bounds of the governor\\'s authority to suggest switzer  clean out his desk and be off the parking lot before the band strikes up the  refrain of \"bye-bye, barry.\" it\\'s obvious the transgressions need to be  addressed from the governor\\'s office and dealt with expeditiously.  oklahoma has been thrown for a severe loss. and what did the president, david  swank, who has the role on a temporary basis, say about it? he reacted by  disclosing the university could lose between 750,000 and 1 million in each of  the next two seasons. athletic director donnie duncan said, \"i think the way of  summing up the way i feel is they wanted us and they got us.\"  this is a play for sympathy, trying to paint a picture of the ncaa  investigators as being biased against the sooners. that\\'s a cop-out. when one  of the dominant football-playing universities in the land puts itself in this  position, how can it permit the man it pays to head its football show to open  his arms and say he didn\\'t know what the men and women he hired were doing?  there has to be a line of responsibility somewhere. and the man out in front  leading the entire effort is the head coach, switzer. does he walk away while  two assistant coaches, mike jones and scott hill, and a recruiting coordinator,  shirley vaughan, who was removed from her job, are painted as scapegoats and  burned at the goal post?  switzer is an adult and has been at oklahoma for 16 years. he knows the burden  is on his shoulders. the university should consider terminating his contract  and suspending football for the next five years. this would demonstrate good  faith and do wonders for reclaiming the clean and ethical reputation oklahoma  deserves to have.

       "  'text': 'it\\'s understandable if steve pate is partial to the san diego area. the pga  tour was in its early stages last year and he had already won two tournaments.  the former ucla all-american won the mony tournament of champions at la costa  followed by a victory in the shearson lehman hutton open, formerly known as the  san diego open.  \"my goal last year was to win twice and i did it in san diego, so i\\'d have to  say it\\'s been a pretty good area for me,\" pate said.  pate would, of course, like the new year to be as rewarding as 1988. winning  early certainly eases any anxiety he might have as to how he\\'s progressing.  pate, 27, who will defend his title in the tournament of champions starting  thursday at la costa, has steadily advanced on the money list in his 4 years on  the tour.  he earned 89,358 in 1985, 176,100 in 1986, 335,728 in 1987 and 582,473 in  1988.  \"after that great start i was hoping to win more,\" pate said. \"i guess i was a  little greedy, but i had a good stretch at the end of the year even though i  didn\\'t win. coming back to la costa puts me in a winning frame of mind again.\"  asked if he has any long-term goals, the simi valley resident said: \"i\\'d like  to win every week but, obviously, that isn\\'t going to happen. i\\'d like to win  more than once this year and defend one of my championships.  \"i haven\\'t made any major changes in my game, or mental approach. i\\'m just  getting better at it, like refining my swing. and i don\\'t let bad things bother  me.\"  pate says the t of c is the best quality field of the year. to qualify one must  win a pga tour tournament, or the british open in the 12 months since the last  tournament of champions.  and there\\'s quite an attrition rate from year to year. of the record 38  qualifiers in 1988, only 13 will return to shoot for the first prize of  135,000 and a total purse of 750,000.  pate, who finished 12th on the money list in 1988, played in 30 tour events in  1988.  \"i\\'m going to try to play less than 30 tournaments this year, but i hate to  read about people making all that money while i\\'m sitting at home.\"  the nabisco championships last november at pebble beach paid curtis strange  360,000 for winning a playoff with tom kite.  asked if the nabisco tournament unfairly tilts the money winning total, pate  said: \"i think it does. that it can swing that much in one week i don\\'t think  is particularly fair. but if i had to make a decision of not having the  tournament, or having it, i\\'d have it the way it is.\"  pate is sometimes confused by galleries with jerry pate, a former u.s. open  winner, whose career has been curtailed by injuries.  steve pate takes it in stride.  \"i don\\'t think i look a whole like jerry,\" \"a lot of people follow me because  they think i\\'m jerry. in an offhand way it gives me more recognition.  \"some people even ask me about diving in a lake.\"  jerry pate made a famous splash after winning the tournament players  championship in 1982 -- and the memory lingers on.  as for steve pate, he might not be adverse to diving in a lake if he shoots  consecutive rounds of 66 as he did last year on his way to winning the rain  abbreviated t of c by a stroke over larry nelson.  after he won last year, taking a check for 90,000, pate said: \"i\\'m not going  to lie to you that i was disappointed that the last round was canceled. a win  is a win. you take it any way you can.\"  he has been sharp lately, shooting a 64 to tie the course record at kapalua in  maui in the kirin cup competition.  it was also a memorable year off the course for pate.  \"i was on the fifth hole playing in the honda tournament when i got word that  my wife, sheri, was about ready to have our first child. i ran off the course,  set a speed record driving to the miami airport and just missed the plane by 2  minutes,\" he said. \"i had to wait 4 hours for the next flight.  \"in los angeles, i raced to the hospital from lax and missed my daughter  nicole\\'s birth by an hour. fortunately, sheri and nicole came through in great  shape, but i was a nervous wreck.\"  golf notes

       "  'text': 'rolf benirschke, the excellent former kicker for the san diego chargers, is  going to be the new host of the daytime \"wheel of fortune.\" a bit of a surprise  choice, wouldn\\'t you say, considering that rolf benirschke is not exactly a  household name -- unless you\\'re in the zendejas house. really, let\\'s say you\\'re  spinning the wheel, and the puzzle\\'s a name, and b, n, r, s, c, h and k are  already lit, and you buy the i and e. now you\\'re looking at the whole name, and  you still can\\'t place it or pronounce it, so you\\'re thinking: it has to be a  trick puzzle. \"pat, i\\'d like to buy an a.\"  last year in an interview, vanna white was asked what tips she would give to  wheel wanna-bes, and she said, \"you have to know the whole alphabet.\"  of course!  how stupid i was to think i could get away with stopping at s.  the way benirschke got the gig is pure hollywood. he was a guest on an l.a.  morning tv show, chatting about staying healthy -- you might remember  benirschke\\'s near-fatal bout with ulcerative colitis -- and who should be  watching the show but jaunty little rich guy merv griffin, creator of \"wheel of  fortune.\" merv was so taken by benirschke, he offered him the host\\'s job on  \"windfall,\" merv\\'s newest game show. according to benirschke\\'s assistant,  debbie marshall, \"merv conveyed this to rolf: \\'you\\'re a genuine, sincere person  who loves people, and that\\'s what i\\'m looking for.\\' \" gosh darn it, that\\'s what  separates merv from the pack, the ability to see all that in one guest shot.  as well he should have been, benirschke was slightly embarrassed. he hadn\\'t  gone to college and majored in zoology to be a game-show host. (years ago i did  a story on rick barry, who told me his ambition was to be a game-show host. he  was the first real, live person to say that to me. before that, i assumed  game-show hosts were bionic ken dolls.) but benirschke agreed to do an  audition. \"it was my illness jumping in,\" benirschke said, explaining,  \"surviving my illness taught me how neat life really is, and that you should  live it and enjoy all of its experiences and possibilities.\"  benirschke\\'s audition was so impressive that merv suggested he forget about  \"windfall\" entirely, and aim higher: at the wheel. in all, 30 tried out for the  wheel, including jimmy connors. (hard to believe jimbo knows all 26 letters. he  usually gets stuck on \"i\" he must have gotten coaching.) why benirschke? this  is a direct quote from shannon williams of merv griffin productions: \"they  liked his open and sincere quality. he was real sincere with vanna. he looks  good with vanna -- that\\'s very important -- they make a good look. (they make a  good look?) vanna likes him. and he understands the game.\" excuse me, the  people who don\\'t understand the game, what stumps them, is it tricky consonants  like j and v? do they think the game is unfair, that it aims too high up the  intelligentsia ladder?  some will ask if rolf benirschke was really the most qualified man to fill pat  sajak\\'s shoes. (we\\'re talking gigantic shoes in game-show annal.) merv liked  him, and that\\'s good enough for me. don\\'t laugh. dan quayle got to be vice  president because george bush liked him, and that was good enough for you. come  to think of it, dan quayle looks just like a game-show host. anyway, what are  the qualifications? the ability to spell his own name seems to overqualify rolf  benirschke for \"wheel of fortune.\" anybody can spell vanna white. well, that  double-n might be too much for some people, but it\\'s not like the only thing  keeping if off pbs.  a fine, bright and charitable fellow -- the nfl\\'s \"man of the year\" in 1983 and  co-chairman of the national foundation for ileitis and colitis -- benirschke  has maintained his sense of humor about his new job. the other day he was asked  if it didn\\'t feel a bit preposterous to be a game-show host, and he said,  \"obviously it does. my father (dr. kurt benirschke) is an internationally known  professor of pathology, a physician, an author, and his son is asking people:  \\'do you want to buy a vowel?\\' \"  in a sense, it\\'s a breakthrough. other athletes have become actors, such as ed  marinaro, mike warren, fred dryer and alex karras. but game-show hosting is a  whole new field for jocks to consider.  eddie (silent movie) murray, for example. he\\'s well suited for a non-verbal  show like \"win, lose or draw.\" tommy lasorda could guest-host, and they could  change the name of the show to \"win, lose or eat.\"  right now, who\\'s in more \"jeopardy\" than jerry tarkanian?  \"the newlywed game\" is a natural for veterans joe montana or hal sutton.  george steinbrenner could host \"the price is right,\" and yell out, \"billy  martin, you sly boots, come on down . . . again!\"  mike and robin absolutely have to co-host \"love connection.\"  for \"the dating game,\" the leaders in the clubhouse are wade (mr. polaroid)  boggs and mark (do you think i\\'m sexy, or simply stupid) gastineau.  so rolf, good luck, we\\'ll be watching. and remember, it\\'s a, e, i, o, u and  sometimes y.

       "  'text': 'rob brown, who resembles benjamin franklin and is almost as quotable, looked at  the questioner as if he were some kind of heretic.  \"does anything mario lemieux do on the ice surprise me?\" brown, 20, a  pittsburgh penguins winger, said, repeating the question. \"people who only see  him play once in a while may be shocked when they see mario make some  incredible move or score some unbelievable goal. but when you see him play all  the time and he\\'s on your team, you are not surprised. you are just thankful  that you can expect his greatness.\"  what brown is describing is routine brilliance.  routine brilliance.  those two words aren\\'t compatible, because there is nothing humdrum about  greatness. but it is within the domain of night-in and night-out performance  that lemieux has risen to such a consistent level that even at 23 he is  knocking on the door of immortality. it is difficult to describe this 6-foot-4,  215-pound skating octopus any other way. lemieux\\'s combination of size, reach,  skill and strength handling the puck are unique.  he\\'s a playmaker with a feathery touch and field of vision second only to wayne  gretzky.  he can work free in front of the net and unleash a sniper\\'s bullet a la phil  esposito in his prime.  and he uses what seems like 15-foot rubber arms to control the puck and the  tempo of the game like no one else in nhl history.  \"god only knows what\\'s going to come from mario lemieux next,\" edmonton\\'s craig  simpson said of his former penguins teammate.  \"when gretzky broke 200 points and went on to set the record (215 points in  1985-86), everybody wondered if it would ever be broken,\" hartford whalers  president and general manager emile francis said. \"forget in gretzky\\'s  lifetime. lemieux might do it while wayne\\'s still in his prime.\"  earlier in his nhl career, the critics complained the kid didn\\'t care enough.  he didn\\'t have enough heart. he was two zones away while his team was on  defense. he turned it on and off as his mood hit and, like the penguins, folded  down the stretch. all that has changed the past two years.  \"wayne gretzky taught mario how to win,\" said mr. hockey, gordie howe. \"in my  mind, mario became a hockey player at last year\\'s canada cup. before he was a  talent, a great talent. but he was weak defensively and didn\\'t seem to be  involved at all times. now, he\\'s damn near as good a hockey player as wayne is.  \"and he can do things that wayne isn\\'t physically able to do. the way he uses  those arms and his strength to control the puck when it\\'s about five feet away  from him is unbelievable. that big son of a gun is something else.\"  as much as the universal gretzky adoration society does not want to admit it,  the time has come when lemieux perhaps should no longer be held in comparison  to gretzky. at this point, gretzky probably should be compared to lemieux.  after being limited to one assist in a 2-2 tie in new jersey on friday, lemieux  entered monday night\\'s game against the whalers at the hartford civic center  leading the nhl with 92 points (36 goals, 56 assists) in 33 games. if lemieux  doesn\\'t miss any more games to injury, his 2.79-points-a-game pace would give  him an nhl record 217 points. his goal pace is headed for 85, which would be  second only to gretzky\\'s 92 goals in 1981-82. all those projections won\\'t mean  a hill of beans if lemieux rips off another 41-point barrage like he did in the  first 12 games of this season before missing a few games with a wrist injury.  \"i want to win the scoring title, with gretzky (82 points), bernie nicholls  (83) and myself there\\'s a challenge,\" lemieux said. \"i want to be the best i  can. but after a while all the lemieux vs. gretzky (comparisons) can get a  little old. i\\'m sure wayne feels the same way. i really admire him. but i want  to be recognized as mario lemieux and judged on what i can do.\"  \"there\\'s got to be some friendly competition between the two,\" brown said. \"but  mario hears it so much. wouldn\\'t you get tired of it, too?\"  the irony is that gretzky served as a teacher in lemieux\\'s maturation process.  gretzky showed lemieux the door to immortality, but lemieux had to be the one  to open it.  at the 1987 canada cup, lemieux played on gretzky\\'s wing. they pushed each  other to a higher level. as team canada coach jean perron said at the time,  \"buckle up because we\\'re going into hockey space.\"  the two complemented each other. they challenged each other. much of it was  done not in words, but in the reflex actions of peerless talents. lemieux  scored 11 goals in nine games. gretzky assisted on nine of them.  for purists, the three-game canada cup series against the soviets may well have  been the greatest hockey ever played. and the riveting overtime thriller in  game 2 at hamilton may have been the greatest single game in hockey history.  lemieux won it. gretzky assisted. in the final minute of the decisive third  game, canada broke the deadlock. goal lemieux. assist gretzky. match to canada.  \"there is no denying how much winning at the canada cup meant to me,\" lemieux  said, criticized in the past for turning down invitations to the world  championships after pittsburgh had failed to make the nhl playoffs. \"wayne was  terrific. it gave me confidence that i could play with the best in the world.\"  howe is big buddies with gretzky. it would be a major upset for him to admit  publicly that lemieux is better. but others have said it.  \"right now, mario lemieux is the best player in the world,\" detroit coach  jacques demers said.  a lemieux vs. gretzky poll in the whalers\\' locker room earlier this season  showed that more players believed lemieux\\'s talent was no. 1, but that they\\'d  still want gretzky when it mattered most.  mike liut said you don\\'t surpass gretzky. you can only match him.  brent peterson said, \"for the regular season, i\\'d take lemieux. for the  playoffs, i\\'d take gretzky.\"  lemieux cannot be shocked by such talk. even though gretzky missed 16 games  because of injury last season, lemieux scored nhl highs of 70 goals and 168  points to break gretzky\\'s run of eight hart trophies as league mvp. and his  six-point performance in last year\\'s all-star game in st. louis was frightening  in its dominance.

       "  'text': 'the heads of 2 commissions that oversee athletics in all public high schools in  southern california said that they were surprised by the findings of a recent  national survey indicating that 1 of every 15 boys in 12th grade has used  anabolic steroids. both said that they have never received a report of a  student using the muscle-building drug.  but a national expert on drug abuse said that steroid use among high school  students is rising sharply and is at epidemic levels in some southern  california communities.  \"it\\'s a frightening situation,\" said dr. forest s. tennant of west covina, a  leader in the treatment of substance abuse. tennant has treated many  professional athletes for cocaine dependency, including former dodger pitcher  steve howe and nba star walter davis. \"i have seen blood-test results from  users of anabolic steroids. i have been shocked to see the dramatic effects  they have on the human body.\"  tennant, who operates a drug abuse treatment center in van nuys, said that his  studies have shown steroids to have a dramatic impact on the adrenal gland and  the immune system and to cause cholesterol levels to soar in most users.  a study published last month in the journal of the american medical assn.,  purported to be the first nationwide survey of steroid use among high school  boys, found that of the 3,403 seniors interviewed at 46 schools, 6.6% of them  said that they were using or had used steroids. most said that they took the  drug to enhance their athletic performance, but 26.7% were non-athletes who  said that they used steroids to build muscles and improve their physical  appearance.  stan thomas, the commissioner of the of the california interscholastic  federation southern section -- which oversees more than 500 schools -- said  that his organization has never had a report of steroid use by a local high  school athlete.  \"none. not a single report,\" thomas said. \"but i am certain it goes on. it\\'s  like marijuana use in your high school. you\\'d be crazy to say it doesn\\'t go on.  it\\'s the same thing with steroids.  \"but i am just overwhelmed to hear those numbers. the numbers are scary.\"  hal harkness, the director of interscholastic athletics for the city section --  which oversees 49 los angeles school district programs -- said that he knows of  no incidents involving steroid use by athletes in city schools.  \"i have had no calls about it, ever,\" he said. \"i have heard absolutely no  comments in over two years in this position from anyone in our schools  regarding steroids.\"  tennant said that the reason for the lack of reports on steroid use by students  is that coaches and administrators don\\'t know what they\\'re looking for.  \"if they are waiting to get reports on steroid use like they get reports of  kids using marijuana or cocaine, then they will never get any reports,\" tennant  said.  \"steroids are not taken in that manner, at lunchtime or at smoke break at  school. steroids are taken in a very programmed way, at a very intentional time  and place, most likely away from the school. users of cocaine and marijuana  take those drugs when they are passed to them.\"  the study reported that more than one-third of the seniors who said they have  taken steroids took them both orally and by injection. only one-fifth of those  who claimed to use steroids said they got the drugs from a health-care  professional. the majority obtained the steroids from other athletes, coaches  and people who frequent gyms, the study said.  tennant said that he began to see widespread steroid use among adolescents 4  years ago.  \"the figures in the national study just released are not only believable, but  in southern california i think they are higher than that,\" he said. \"it is  spotty. in some communities people have never seen or heard about anabolic  steroids. in others, it\\'s an epidemic. as long as four years ago, i had  substantiated reports of parents and coaches giving steroids to little league  baseball players and pop warner football players.  \"this study is a validation of something i have seen for the last four years. i  support what it said and i agree with its findings.\"  tennant was especially alarmed at the reasons some steroid users gave for  taking the drug.  \"the most frightening aspect of steroid use is that adolescents are using them  to alter their basic physical appearance,\" he said. \"they perceive that doing  that will make them more sexually attractive or give them some success in life  that they can\\'t achieve otherwise. it symbolizes something that has gone sour  in our society, that our natural body and our natural talents are not worthy  anymore.\"  bill redell, a veteran high school football coach who recently resigned from  his post at crespi high, said that he encountered only 1 player at crespi whom  he suspected of using steroids. but he said that the results of the national  study are not unexpected.  \"it didn\\'t surprise me a bit to see those numbers,\" said redell, who also  played and coached in the defunct u. s. football league. \"the pressure on the  kids today to win, and to perform well, is greater than ever. there are parents  who pressure their own kids into taking steroids, not only not condemning  steroid use but actually encouraging it. the pressure is to gain major college  scholarships.\"  canyon high coach harry welch, who has run the valley-area\\'s most successful  football program for the past 7 years, said that he has never encountered  steroid use among his players.  \"we discuss drugs but i haven\\'t discussed steroids because i\\'ve never seen the  need,\" he said.  welch added that he condemns steroid use, equating it with so-called  recreational drugs.  \"it really scares me,\" he said. \"i\\'ve read that it affects the reproductive  system. to even flirt with using something that could affect your sexual  identity or the future of your children . . . i would condemn it in the  harshest way.\"  cleveland high coach steve landress found it difficult to believe the  statistics, saying that he has never heard of high school athletes -- or  students -- using steroids during his 13 years of coaching.  he especially ruled out athletes, saying top players have no need for such  drugs at the high school level.  \"guys who are division i-type players are so much better than other players  they don\\'t need it,\" he said. \"even a few years ago when it wasn\\'t such a big  thing to say you used steroids, i never heard anyone talk about it.\"  thomas said that the southern section has never discussed the issue of steroids  with coaches and has never sent memos to coaches informing them of indications  of steroid use by players.  \"i guess we felt it should be common sense,\" thomas said. \"if a kid goes from  165 pounds to 205 pounds in six months, a coach should have a clue that  steroids might be involved. i guess we assumed they would know. but i\\'m not  satisfied anymore with where we are with this issue. we have to do more.\"  thomas, however, said that the southern section has no firm plan to deal with  steroid use. he said that the organization is involved in an educational  program sponsored by the los angeles amateur athletic foundation and is  participating in another steroid awareness program sponsored by the orange  county sheriff\\'s deparment.  \"we have run articles about steroid use in our football game programs,\" thomas  said.  testing players for steroids has never been seriously considered, he said.  \"i honestly have to admit we have been remiss in the world of drug abuse,\"  thomas said. \"drugs are a problem in our high schools in general, but the cif  southern section should take a leadership role (against) drug abuse, including  the use of steroids.\"  harkness said that the city section may implement a steroid awareness program  early next year. there will be no drug testing, however.  \"we will not even consider voluntary drug testing,\" he said. \"to begin with,  voluntary testing is not effective. those individuals who even think they might  test positively for steroids simply won\\'t volunteer for the testing. and  mandatory testing is absolutely out of the question. we just don\\'t have the  right

here only to  spend a little time in your young years competing, learning team spirit and  discipline and fitness and competition. anabolic steroids just don\\'t have a  place in that. they don\\'t

       "  'text': 'santa monica and ventura.  that is the answer, which comes without hesitation, from western state  conference basketball coaches asked to name the favorites in this season\\'s race  for the wsc title.  \"those two are head and shoulders above everyone else in the conference  talent-wise,\" glendale coach brian beauchemin said. \"everybody else is right  there together.\"  santa monica and ventura shared the championship last season with 11-2 records,  and no one affiliated with the conference is bold enough to predict that it  might not be a similar scenario this time around.  the wsc has been slightly realigned after the defection of allan hancock  college to the central valley conference and the entry of valley and west los  angeles.  valley, which played in the southern california conference last season, and  west l. a. will join the south division, which also includes santa monica,  canyons, glendale and bakersfield. the north division comprises ventura,  moorpark, cuesta, santa barbara and oxnard.  santa monica coach john mcmullen grudgingly admits that his corsairs may be the  team to beat.  \"i suppose on our preseason record and returning lettermen that\\'s the case,\"  said mcmullen, whose team is 15-3 and has won the rancho santiago, compton,  merced and pasadena tournaments. \"if that\\'s true, we\\'re not that far ahead of  anybody else. i\\'ve seen valley, canyons, moorpark and glendale, and they\\'re all  competitive.\"  indeed, all of the valley-area teams have tasted success during the  preconference schedule.  canyons (9-8), though plagued by inconsistency, has looked spectacular at  times.  the cougars finished 8-5 in the wsc last season and made the playoffs for the  fourth year in a row. this season, they finished second in the glendale  tournament.  lee smelser, in his 20th season as coach at canyons, said the wsc likely will  be one of the best conferences in the state. whether his team will be among the  best in the conference, however, will depend on its ability to eliminate  mistakes.  \"we\\'re in a manner of transition, trying to be halfway decent and struggling,\"  said smelser, whose team opens wsc play tuesday at west l. a. \"we haven\\'t been  able to put the whole package together. that\\'s been kind of frustrating.\"  for a variety of reasons, glendale (9-6) lost 4 players -- potentially, a  strong nucleus -- from a young team that finished 6-7 in the wsc last season.  the vaqueros, who open wsc play wednesday at santa monica, are once again a  young outfit, but the team has shown steady improvement despite its youth.  \"we\\'re doing all right considering what happened,\" said beauchemin, who is in  his 10th season with the vaqueros. \"the players are starting to respond.\"  valley (10-6), which joins the wsc after competing in the southern california  conference, has a talented team led by center oral elrington and could give  some teams trouble if the monarchs are able to develop depth. valley\\'s first  test comes wednesday at bakersfield.  moorpark (8-7 entering the weekend), though dominated by freshmen, should  improve steadily under al nordquist, who is in his 22nd season with the  raiders.  point guard roger thomas, a freshman from leuzinger high, is averaging 10.9  points a game to lead the raiders. moorpark opens its conference schedule  wednesday at home against cuesta.  oxnard, which finished 1-12 last season, is the most improved team in the wsc.  santa barbara won its own tournament and also is considered a conference dark  horse.  but in a conference with santa monica and ventura, every team is a long-shot to  displace the reigning co-champions.  ventura (13-2 entering the weekend) might have lost conference mvp cedric  ceballos, but the pirates have been buoyed by the play of all-conference point  guard tony walker, who is averaging 9.6 assists, and freshman forward reggie  betton, who is averaging 13.9 points.  ventura, which opens wsc play wednesday at santa barbara, has won the cypress  and ventura tournaments.  santa monica has 7 players back from a team that lost to merced in the  quarterfinals of the state tournament last season, including all-wsc forward  keith amerson, forwards von shuler and kemo patrick and guards deshawn pullard  and troy batiste, all of whom average more than 10 points.  \"it looks to me as if this is one of the strongest conferences overall in  southern california,\" mcmullen said. \"i feel that everybody has a team that can  beat anybody else on a given night.\"  '},\n",

       "  'text': 'foster andersen at a high school football game: he draws a bead on an offensive  lineman\\'s feet. are they quick feet? or slow feet? then he focuses on a  defensive back\\'s hips. how fast can they switch gears from forward to reverse?  next, he zeroes in on a receiver\\'s hands. soft or hard? and the quarterback\\'s  arm. how strong?  to andersen, winning isn\\'t everything, anatomy is. every week during the  football season, he sees a minimum of 3 high school and 2 junior college games.  he doesn\\'t care about results. he doesn\\'t root. he just scrutinizes hands and  feet and hips and arms and puts all the body parts together to form a  well-rounded opinion of a player.  as the owner of sports search, a scouting service he runs out of his granada  hills home, andersen judges football prospects and sells his evaluations to  major colleges such as usc, ucla and miami.  this past season, he and 2 associates analyzed the college potential of 400  high school and 400 junior college players in the vast football caldron of  southern california. that\\'s a lot of body parts.  \"but i never get tired of going to games,\" says andersen, 48, a two-way lineman  for ucla in the early 1960s and former head coach at cal state l. a. \"it\\'s the  parking that bugs me.\"  scouting services such as andersen\\'s are in vogue -- usc subscribes to about 50  -- because the ncaa has tightened the screws on recruiting. as of this year,  colleges cannot even scout a prospect until nov. 1. to cover ground quickly and  thoroughly, they buy reports from scouting services, which rate the best  players. andersen sells his service for as much as 800 a year for voluminous  compilations or as little as 75 for, say, a breakdown on quarterbacks.  \"our reports allow a college staff to prioritize its time,\" andersen says. \"we  tell them who they should concentrate on and who\\'s a waste of time.\"  the fear of missing a blue-chip player also drives colleges to subscribe to  scouting services. \"we cross-reference players rated by the various services,\"  says usc recruiting coordinator jack himebauch.  andersen assigns a rating to each player he scouts. the best is a 1+, which  represents \"the guys i\\'d want if i were coach at usc or ucla,\" he says. players  rated as a 1 or 1- are division i caliber. a 2+ would be the best player  available for division ii schools. of the 400 high school players he has  evaluated this year, \"150 are capable of playing in division i and maybe 30 are  rated 1+,\" he says.  but his ratings are not chiseled in stone. colleges use scouting services as an  aid, not a directive, often disagreeing with or ignoring their recommendations.  \"coaches still make their own evaluations,\" himebauch says. \"they don\\'t rely on  somebody else\\'s opinion to offer a player a scholarship.\"  last year, andersen says he was pushing jack swan of el camino royal high as  \"the best offensive lineman in the valley.\" but neither usc nor ucla recruited  him, andersen says, because at 6-3, he was shorter than their prototype  lineman. but one of sports search\\'s subscribers, the university of georgia,  gave swan a scholarship and \"think they stole him out of southern california,\"  andersen says.  andersen puts all his information in an ibm computer in the family room of his  ranch house. players are listed alphabetically and by position. aside from  ratings, andersen includes capsule comments on each player, \"little bits of  information coaches like.\" typing on the computer keyboard -- \"i had to learn  to type to go into this business,\" he says -- andersen called up hart high  tight end brian allen. the comment read:  \"catches with hands. doesn\\'t look like he\\'ll fill out for different positions  because of body type.\"  andersen explained, \"coaches don\\'t necessarily like receivers who catch the  ball against their pads, and they also want to know if a prospect has the  potential to play other positions,\" such as offensive or defensive line.  in the analysis of crespi running back russell white, andersen mentioned that  he could also be \"a great defensive back.\" white, of course, got andersen\\'s  highest rating despite nagging injuries and a \"weak offensive line\" this  season. \"i watched him in practice,\" andersen says, \"and his work ethic is  very, very good.\"  but who is the best back in the l. a. area? andersen likes hawthorne  quarterback curtis conway, projecting him as a college tailback. andersen\\'s  computer comment says conway \"may be the next marcus allen.\"  an assistant coach at usc under ted tollner, andersen was out of a job when  larry smith brought in his own assistants 2 years ago. so andersen, along with  computer expert dick laugens, started sports search, hiring former usc  assistants larry bryan and nate shaw to help with the scouting. they specialize  in southern california players \"because california supplies 15% of the players  in division i,\" andersen says.  andersen has opinions on where to find the best players in the area. \"banning  and carson have the premier concentration of athletes in public schools,\" he  says. \"in private schools, it\\'s loyola and crespi. they have good coaches and  an administration that wants football to be a unifying force on campus.\"  andersen says that san fernando high has the best talent in the valley this  year and orange county \"is where you\\'ll find the great linemen.\" inner-city  schools, he says, \"traditionally produce great running backs and receivers.\"  andersen sometimes disagrees with all-star teams, which he says are based on  \"politics.\" for instance, the golden league put defensive lineman sean mccune  of canyon high on its second team. \"i think he\\'d leave some of the first team  in the dirt,\" andersen says. he gave granada hills defensive lineman anthony  hall a 1+ but hall didn\\'t make all-north valley league.  although the 1988 season is behind him, andersen will not be taking it easy  until the fall.  scouting is a full-time, year-round job. \"we\\'re working on our spring list --  juniors in high school,\" he says. so he will be attending spring practices --  and watching lots of body parts.

       "  'text': 'with apologies to david letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in  1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989.   seven reasons why the 1988 america\\'s cup defense was a farce:  1. it did not occur to new zealand\\'s michael fay that stars &amp stripes would  be a catamaran.  new zealand had made its surprise challenge in a 90-foot monohull in july 1987,  assuming sail america would respond in kind.  the kiwi challenge, based on a literal interpretation of the america\\'s cup deed  of gift, was upheld in the new york supreme court in november 1987.  but the same literal interpretation of the deed of gift caused sail america to  respond with the catamaran.  2. san diego, home of the san diego yacht club, was left hanging for months on  whether the 1988 races would be held off the san diego coast.  at one point, the city of san diego was actually rebuffed in court in an  attempt to assert its right to be a party to the competition.  indeed, on jan. 22, sail america announced that the races would be held off  either long beach or hawaii. in march, sail america finally announced that the  races would be off the san diego coast in september.  3. michael fay complained about stars &amp stripes\\' commercialism.  responding to the marlboro logo on stars &amp stripes, new zealand hoisted a  sail that said: \"surgeon general\\'s warning: quitting smoking now greatly  reduces serious risks to your health\" in the days leading up to the first race.  curiously, stars &amp stripes skipper dennis conner was race commodore for an  american cancer society regatta.  4. michael fay whined and complained about how horrible this mismatch was going  to be.  for months and months, he complained.  encountering a couple of women bicyclists near the kiwi compound, he said: \"do  you ladies know what this race will be like? why, it will be like you two  racing your bicycles against motorbikes.\"  just before the racing, fay announced the results of a kiwi-commissioned gallup  poll which concluded that 53% of americans thought the race was unfair.  he did not make a big issue of the fact that 51% of americans polled were  unaware of any such controversy.  5. the races were horrible mismatches.  stars &amp stripes won the first race by 18 minutes 15 seconds on sept. 7 and  concluded a sweep of the best-of-three series with a 21-minute 10-second  victory 2 days later.  6. sportsmanship was as horrible as the competition.  the kiwis accused conner of intentionally sandbagging to keep the margin of  victory from being even greater than it was.  \"i consider what they did to be disgraceful,\" skipper david barnes said.  \"they should have gone out there and beaten us by 1 1/2 to 2 hours,\" designer  bruce farr said.  that was after the first race. after the second race, a press conference turned  into a literal and verbal shoving match with grown men called each other liars  and losers.  7. it\\'s not over.  naturally, michael fay went back to the new york supreme court to ask that the  race be forfeited to new zealand because of how unfair it was that his monohull  had to race against a catamaran.  presumably, the outcome of this continuing legal hassle will provide a farcical  beginning to 1989. dave distel  '},\n",

(tom watson did it in 1980.)  pate\\'s putt gave him a final round of 68 and a 72-hole total of 19-under par  269.  pate also will be the last andy williams winner. after a 21-year affiliation,  the century club of san diego announced nov. 22 that williams has ended his  involvement as host of the tournament. it will now be known as the shearson  lehman hutton open.  2. the meet belongs to

fouls, but her first -- 24 feet 3 inches -- was just 2 1/2 inches  short of her american record. after competing, joyner-kersee attended the  wedding of ucla\\'s gail devers, formerly of sweetwater, and ron roberts, a  former bruin distance runner.  florence griffith joyner -- flo jo -- gave an indication of olympic glory to  come, winning the 100 meters in 10.89 seconds.  mary decker slaney had an easy time in the 2,000 meters, winning in 5 minutes  36.35 seconds. ramona pagel became the first american woman to surpass 20  meters in the shot put with a throw of 66-2 1/2.  3. and the rest of the story.   -- joan hansen, a solana beach distance runner, decided not to try to compete  in her second olympics in 1988, opting instead to help start the san diego  national athletes fund, a nonprofit corporation designed to raise money for  local athletes in training. in \\'84, hansen ran in the 3,000-meter race with  mary decker. both fell, but few knew about hansen because of the controversy  surrounding decker, who didn\\'t finish. hansen did, placing eighth.   -- major league volleyball was a major league bust in may. just 254 fans  showed up for a match between the new york liberties and the chicago breeze.  the breeze won. the mlv lost. the paltry attendance figures didn\\'t entice san  diego investors to support a team here.   -- in june, it was announced that san

       "  'text': 'was 1988 the year of the dead in the orange county arts scene? well, it was the  year pacific symphony conductor keith clark was termed \"a dead fish,\" the year  william shakespeare was nearly a dead duck in garden grove and the year the  rock zanies in oingo boingo held yet another \"dead man\\'s party\" at irvine  meadows amphitheatre.   jokes notwithstanding, there were encouraging signs of life locally. south  coast repertory theatre won major national recognition with the 1988 tony award  as best regional theater in the country. the grove theatre co. triumphed over  considerable civic adversity that threatened for a time to shut down the  county\\'s only annual shakespeare festival. the pacific symphony demonstrated  new enthusiasm, with concerts led by guest conductors vying for the  soon-to-be-vacated music director post.  local rock bands seemed to flourish, live and on record, despite a paucity of  clubs in the county that would book them or radio stations that would air their  music. the improv in irvine paved the way for a significant increase in the  quantity and quality of stand-up comedy in the county.   with that in mind, in the following four pages critics for the times orange  county edition offer compendiums of the best -- and in some cases, the worst  and the silliest -- that the county had to offer during the year in art, music,  dance, theater, pop and comedy.   *international star fernando bujones danced lensky in john cranko\\'s \"onegin\"  as a guest with the national ballet of canada, june 7 to 12, at the center. but  the company was not lacking in its own roster of dancers. among a trio of  casts, sabina allemann was a most lyric, expressive tatiana, and frank augustyn  a cold, world-weary onegin.  the canadians also brought glen tetley\\'s \"alice,\" with kimberly glasco as a  melting young alice and rex harrington as a byronic lewis carroll.  as a curtain-raiser, the company danced no less than balanchine\\'s profound \"the  four temperaments\" -- and danced it superbly.  *merche esmeralda brought demonic power, shattering intensity to \"medea\" during  the royal spanish national ballet run at the center, aug. 2 to 7.  *american ballet theatre unveiled a costly new staging of \"swan lake\" by  company artistic director mikhail baryshnikov during its nov. 29 to dec. 11 run  at the center. five pairs of swan queens and siegfrieds danced in orange  county.  abt excelled in balanchine\\'s masterpiece, \"stravinsky violin concerto.\"  also during abt\\'s run, three former members of twyla tharp dance company (kevin  o\\'day, jamie bishton and daniel sanchez) -- folded into the new york company  now that tharp is artistic associate of abt -- appeared in her inventive,  virtuoso \"the fugue,\" danced to silence.  *the dance department at orange coast college in costa mesa sponsored two dance  and music events in october and netted about 3,000 to benefit action (aids  coalition to identify orange county needs), a 4-year-old grass-roots  organization that provides educational services and coordinates informational  meetings for the public, among other aims.  participating groups included rhapsody in taps (formerly ltd/dance unlimited),  the gloria newman dance theatre, ecos de espana, middle eastern dancer angelika  nemeth and composer lisbeth woodies. chris pasles  '},\n",

       "  'text': 'san diego gas &amp electric co. filed a 500,000 lawsuit against a lakeside  couple for allegedly stealing more than 40,000 worth of gas and electricity  from the utility over three years. beth eagleson, sdg&ampe\\'s corporate  attorney, said friday that the suit against jerry p. and cathy a. goulart seeks  to recover punitive damages and about 42,500 worth of energy stolen from the  utility. \"based upon measurement of actual use compared to their load  information, a back bill for gas and electric service was prepared,\" eagleson  said. according to company spokesman dave smith, load information refers to the  energy used by household appliances. the law allows utilities to try to recover  the cost of stolen electricity, plus treble damages. in this case, eagleson  said, that amounts to 127,789.50. in addition, she said, sdg&ampe is seeking  300,000 in punitive damages. eagleson did not say how the goularts\\' case was  discovered. according to the san diego county district attorney\\'s office,  criminal charges are also involved. in addition to fiscal penalties, eagleson  said, \"it\\'s important to remember that energy diversion is also dangerous.\"  ',\n",

       "  'text': 'in orange county in 1988, the natural disasters were few. the human misfortunes  were many.  the ground didn\\'t shake too much, and even the drought-parched canyons did not  ignite. true, there was the winter storm early in the year that caused the  newly rebuilt huntington beach pier to collapse.  but that was nothing compared to the collapse of careers and the tumbling of  stature among many of the county\\'s once-towering figures.  it was the year that the mighty fell:  * a rising star in the republican party plummeted when he forged a signature on  a check in a last-ditch effort to bail out his campaign for congress.  * a millionaire video producer from newport beach was charged with making  illegal campaign contributions to failed democratic presidential hopeful gary  hart and other candidates.  * an orange county supervisor, running for congress, was caught red-faced when  it was revealed that she did not graduate from college, as her biographies  stated.  * even the always-powerful orange county republican party took it on the chin  when it posted uniformed security guards at polling places in latino areas of  santa ana to warn non-citizens not to vote, prompting an fbi investigation into  allegations of voter intimidation.  indeed, 1988 was the election year that many people would like to forget.  in january, the venerable rep. robert e. badham (r-newport beach), a six-term  congressman, surprised supporters by announcing that he would not run for  reelection, which opened the door to a free-for-all that led to a promising  young politician\\'s demise.  c. david baker, irvine city councilman and former college basketball star,  seemed to be the heir-apparent to badham\\'s seat until c. christopher cox gave  him a run for his money in the june primary. and when that money began to run  short in the final days before the election, a desperate baker turned to the  bank account of a nonprofit health foundation that he directed for an advance  on a loan that was a few days late. he wrote a 48,000 check to himself,  signing his own name and forging the signature of a judge, a foundation  director. he stopped payment on the check shortly after it was written, but the  damage was done.  baker, who was narrowly defeated by cox, pleaded guilty to a felony forgery  count, but a superior court judge later reduced the charge to a misdemeanor.  the judge ordered baker to perform community service and gave him a year\\'s  probation and a 1-year suspended jail sentence.  \"regardless of what the penalty was today, this will not be over,\" baker said  on the day he was sentenced. even when the sentence was imposed, baker was  delivering hot meals to the elderly and working with children. \"some good will  come out of this one way or another. i\\'m not really sure how.\"  another legislative seat unexpectedly opened with the death of assemblyman  richard e. longshore (r-santa ana) the day after voters nominated him for a  second term.  that opened up a king-sized contest between republicans and democrats for his  seat, and that race, too, led to a finish-line stumble.  sent out the guards  in their fervor to see their candidate, curt pringle, win, county republican  party officials not only got out the vote on nov. 8, they also sent out the  guards.  uniformed security guards were hired by the party to stand watch at heavily  latino polling places to warn people that it was illegal for non-citizens to  vote. the democrats cried foul, and even high-ranking republicans denounced the  move. the fbi and district attorney\\'s office are now investigating whether  election laws were violated, and several latino and labor organizations have  filed suit to overturn the election results in the 72nd assembly district,  where pringle ended up winning by a mere 867 votes.  supervisor harriett m. wieder\\'s election foibles left her with a red face.  running for congress in the june primary, wieder conceded under pressure from  her opponent that she had left uncorrected a 25-year-old error on her biography  that stated she had received a bachelor\\'s degree in journalism from wayne state  university in detroit. in truth, she was unable to attend college because of  family finances. also under fire from slow-growth advocates for her votes on  development agreements, wieder lost the race.  karl stubbed his toe  republicans did not have a monopoly on election-year problems. stuart karl jr.,  the millionaire producer of the jane fonda workout tapes, was fined 60,000 and  placed on 3 years\\' probation for making 185,000 in illegal campaign  contributions to self-destructing presidential candidate gary hart and others.  \"to be honest, i\\'m not sure why i did these things,\" karl said after his  sentencing. \"you\\'re attracted to the lure of being involved. people begin to  make you feel important. i should have looked deeper and not done the things i  did. . . . \"  hamburger magnate carl n. karcher also took a tumble. known for his fast food  and patriotism, the founder of carl\\'s jr. restaurants was accused by the  federal government of insider trading, for allegedly tipping off his relatives  about some bad news that his company was about to release. while a federal  judge has ruled that karcher\\'s son, carl leo karcher, did engage in the illegal  behavior, the case against the senior karcher is still pending.  \"these charges are totally false,\" karcher said after the civil lawsuit was  filed in april. \"my wife and i did not sell any of our stock, nor did we tell  anyone else to do so. . . . to suggest that any of us would intentionally  violate the securities laws is highly offensive.\"  crystal cathedral cutback  even god\\'s squad was taken down a notch or two in 1988. while televangelist  robert h. schuller stayed clear of the scandals that rocked his collared  colleagues, the fallout hit the crystal cathedral in garden grove. in may,  schuller announced sharp cutbacks in his \"hour of power\" broadcast ministry, a  result of reduced contributions because of televangelism scandal \"shock waves,\"  the october, 1987, stock market crash and the decision by a new york city cable  television station to eliminate paid religious programming.  still, not everyone had a bad 1988. braving the siberian cold, marathon swimmer  lynne cox of los alamitos became the first person to navigate a significant  distance across the soviet union\\'s lake baikal, the world\\'s deepest lake.  america\\'s darling and placentia\\'s own janet evans won three gold medals in the  pool at the summer olympics in seoul.  and despite the misfortunes of other politicians, two former white house aides  were launched on promising careers. cox, after toughing it out with baker in  the congressional primary, sailed to easy victory in november. dana  rohrabacher, after tipping off voters to wieder\\'s erroneous resume, was elected  to the 42nd congressional district post that was vacated by daniel e. lungren  (r-long beach), who tried -- and failed -- to become the state\\'s treasurer.  political comeback  still, there was perhaps no bigger political comeback in orange county in 1988  than the one that took place on a gentle hillside in yorba linda.  the honoree was not able to attend, but hundreds of supporters gathered to  watch a bulldozer scrape up the first bucket of dirt where a library soon will  stand to house the papers and mementos of orange county\\'s native son and the  nation\\'s only resigned president, richard m. nixon.  times orange county edition librarian dan crump assisted in the research of  this article.

(what\\'s so funny about peace, love and understanding?)  she was a bigger hit than angel catcher bob boone, who had his best year  batting and then bolted the angels for the kansas city royals for just one  dollar more than he earned with the angels in 1988.  evans headed an amazing army of orange county athletes under 21 years of age  who showed up their elders during the year. placentia\\'s michael chang, 16,  became the youngest male to win a singles match at wimbledon and went on to  become, along with andre agassi, the next great hope for american tennis.  placentia\\'s michele granger, 18, now a freshman at california, was recognized  as the world\\'s greatest softball pitcher, setting a dizzying array of national  softball pitching records while at valencia high.  there was servite high\\'s derek brown, 17, who set the county single-season  rushing record and university of houston running back chuck weatherspoon, 20, a  la habra high alumnus who rushed for 1,005 yards and led the nation in yards  per carry (8.5).  there were elaine youngs (el toro), jenny evans (newport harbor) and laurie  jones (huntington beach) who, as freshmen, played major roles on the ucla  women\\'s volleyball team that went 34-0 before losing in the semifinals of the  ncaa championships. bob hamelin, at age 20, batted .514 for rancho santiago  college and hit a state-record 31 home runs and 105 rbis in 48 games.  the mater dei boys\\' basketball team won its fourth consecutive 5-a championship  despite recruiting allegations made against its athletic programs and the  team\\'s failure to win the league title.  corona del mar high, with an enrollment of only 1,400, won southern section  championships in girls\\' track, girls\\' tennis, water polo, football and a state  championship in boys\\' cross-country.  the irvine high girls\\' volleyball team won its second straight state  championship.  the grownups\\' table -- filled with resignations, firings, disappointment and  guys named moose -- did have some bright spots.  greg louganis of the mission viejo nadadores became the first male to sweep  gold medals in diving in two olympics. newport harbor\\'s greg barton won two  gold medals in kayaking during the summer olympics, becoming the first american  to win a gold medal in singles kayaking. the rams\\' jim everett set team  single-season records for pass completions, yards and touchdowns. receiver  henry ellard set a season record for receptions. the angels\\' johnny ray was an  all-star.  but overall, it was the kids who were more than all right in 1988. and leading  the way were . . .  not just janet anymore  dr. john troup, director of u.s. swimming inc., had tested more than 1,000  swimmers for energy efficiency when he came across janet evans. after testing  her prior to the summer games, he proclaimed evans the most energy efficient  \"male or female\" swimmer today.  \"i\\'ll stop short of saying janet\\'s a fish,\" said troup, in a sports illustrated  article, \"but physiologically she\\'s very similar.\"  whatever she was, she was like nothing most people had ever seen -- three gold  medals and one world record in events long dominated by women with thick  shoulders.  she tore through the olympic pool with a slapping stroke that, above water,  looked like the last desperate plea of a drowning victim.  experts told us what happens above the water doesn\\'t matter, it\\'s what happens  below, and below the water, they said, janet evans was perfect.  three gold medals made that easy to figure. but what seemed to endear evans to  the american public was what happened above the water: the block-long smile,  the giggles, the absolute absence of pretense.  she became insta-star, america\\'s kid sister. swimmer matt biondi won more gold  medals (5), sprinter florence griffith joyner was more awesome to watch, carl  lewis and greg louganis might have proven themselves the nation\\'s greatest  olympians, but no american came back from seoul more adored than janet evans.  she walked off a plane and in front of a television camera. make that cameras.  returning to placentia, the evans\\' family car passed under banners thanking  janet, lawns drafting her (\"janet for mayor,\" the placards read) and home to a  block party attended by 500 close friends, well-wishers, strangers, gawkers and  minicams.  her first day back at school was no less hectic: battalions of reporters and  photographers descending upon el dorado high.  she appeared with rich man, johnny carson of the tonight show, and poorman, on  kroq radio with deejay the poorman, and received an invitation to the white  house from the man.  she rode in the disneyland parade, the macy\\'s thanksgiving parade and was grand  marshal of the placentia heritage days parade.  naively, she observed, \"i\\'ve never come from a meet and had anything like this  happen.\"  looking back with several months of perspective, she revised, \"i guess i should  have realized that it was the olympics.\"  she said that sitting in a hotel room in phoenix, the day before she was to be  grand marshal of the fiesta day parade. she has been the toast at banquets,  luncheons and award presentations. but she has refused to sign any endorsement  deals.  though the media demand for her is much less frenzied, \"it\\'s died down a lot,\"  it is still constant -- there are a couple national magazine covers planned for  her for early 1989. there are more than a few companies that would love to have  her on their side of the debit column. but no. one call to biondi, who did sign  the endorsement deals, persuaded her.  \"he told me he didn\\'t have a home, that he just lived from hotel room to hotel  room, \\'just going where they tell me to,\\' \" evans said. \"we talked to them  (companies) and they said i could make a lot of money but it would be a  full-time job, that i would be so busy that i wouldn\\'t be able to finish high  school.  \"i know if i did it, i could be set for life, but finishing high school is very  important to me, so i said no.\"  and then she probably smiled.  three in a fishbowl  michael chang stepped into 1988 already having the distinction of being the  youngest male tennis player to win the u.s. tennis assn. national 18-and-under  singles title and the youngest to win a singles match at the u.s. open.  in 1988, at 16, he became the youngest to win a singles match at wimbledon. he  advanced to the u.s. open\\'s fourth round this year before being eliminated by  the 18-year-old agassi.  with the best tennis players in the world now residing in west germany and  sweden, chang and agassi\\'s coming of age signaled hope for american men\\'s  tennis, which has been mired in post-jimbo/big mac depression.  like agassi, chang hits the ball with amazing velocity and moves his body just  about as fast. pancho segura compared him to a young ken rosewall.  france\\'s henry leconte succinctly summed up chang\\'s past, present and future  when he said, \"he moves so quickly with such good timing. i\\'m thinking,  \\'sixteen years old?\\' god.\"  michele granger did everything in 1988 to confirm that she is the best softball  pitcher in the world. she ended her high school career at valencia holding  national records for single-season strikeouts, career strikeouts, career  no-hitters and tied the mark for single-season no-hitters.  but while she has won numerous national and international titles -- including a  gold medal during the 1987 pan american games -- she failed to win a southern  section championship in her 4 years at valencia high. her high school career  came to a bizarre end during a 25-inning, 3-a semifinal game against la mirada  that took 2 days to play.  valencia had 10 hits in the game but failed to score. the tigers also made 9  errors, 3 of which led to la mirada\\'s 1 run and the victory. granger struck out  40 in the game and afterward, in, perhaps, 1988\\'s greatest overstatement said,  \"i let my team down.\"  derek brown came into 1988 having performed well in 2 varsity seasons as the  starting tailback for arguably orange county\\'s highest-profile football program  -- servite high in anaheim. but he played in the long shadow cast by crespi  high\\'s russell white, who came into this year a two-time winner of the  large-school division\\'s most valuable player award.  white began the season with the publicity, but brown eventually made the season  his own. in a memorable october meeting between the two backs, brown outgained  white 312 yards to 81 as servite won the game 35-20.  brown went on to lead the southern section in rushing and set an orange county  single-season rushing record with 2,301 yards. he and fountain valley  quarterback david henigan were named co-division 1 most valuable players.  when it was clear that brown was having a better season than white, the crespi  back quipped, \"he better remember who was the originator and who is the  imitator.\"  by year\\'s end, derek brown and the rest of orange county\\'s kid wonders made  certain they\\'d be remembered for quite a while.

       "  'text': 'on friday, the last trading day of 1988, the dow jones industrial average  briefly climbed above the level it had enjoyed before the october, 1987, market  collapse. it was a fitting end to a year that proved stronger than expected,  with the dow increasing 12%.  it was equally fitting that the best performing orange county stocks of 1988  were among those hardest hit by the crash.  orange county\\'s star performers managed to rescue themselves from the rubble to  either approach or surpass their pre-crash highs. in most cases, analysts said,  they are solid companies that enjoyed healthy returns.  icn biomedicals, a costa mesa medical instruments and chemicals company, led  the pack on a percentage basis. the stock rose 331%, starting the year at 3.25  and finishing at 14.  for the first 9 months of its current fiscal year, icn biomedicals has enjoyed  a 35% increase in earnings. its third-quarter performance was even stronger,  with profits up 59%.  gradco corp., an irvine manufacturer of office copier and printer products,  placed second, appreciating 126% for the year. gradco stock, which began the  year at 5.875, closed at 13.25.  in the fiscal year ended march, 1988, gradco reported net income of 4.1  million on sales of 90.9 million, and the company continued to post strong  numbers over the latter part of the year.  during the past 12 months, most investors steered clear of small companies.  many had been burned badly by the crash.  \"a lot of the smaller orange county companies are not very liquid, and they  just got hammered in the crash, as people fell over themselves to get out of  them,\" said larry selwitz, director of research at cruttenden &amp co., a  newport beach brokerage.  many investors who got back into the market in 1988 initially chose to buy  stocks in larger, more established companies.  but as the year wore on and many orange county companies began to report strong  earnings, investors started funneling money into such companies as icn  biomedicals, ropak and gradco.  \"the stock of some of these companies had become so oversold that people  realized these prices offered unusually good value,\" selwitz said. \"it was an  opportunity for people to make a lot of money.\"  meanwhile, the county\\'s biggest market losers generally reflected unspectacular  corporate performance.  resdel industries, a newport beach electronics firm, lost the most ground in  1988. its stock began the year at 5.25 a share and crashed to 1.4375, a 73%  decline.  the company posted an 8.3-million loss for the year ended june 30 and  disclosed in october that it had laid off 130 people, or more than a third of  its work force. the firm\\'s problems were attributed primarily to unsuccessful  efforts to expand through acquisitions.  another bomb was diceon electronics, which began the year trading at 30.50 but  declined to 12.50 at year end, losing 59% of its value.  diceon had sales of 147 million and earned 9.8 million in the fiscal year  ended in september. but most of its profits were realized in the first 6 months  of the year, while the second half was a dud. analysts are projecting that the  company will have flat earnings for the first half of 1989.  as a result, diceon, which for several years has been one of orange county\\'s  top performing growth companies, was snubbed by analysts and investors.  preston athey, a growth fund manager for t. rowe price in baltimore, said he  continues to hold diceon and several other orange county stocks because of what  he believes are bright prospects for small growth companies in 1989.  t. rowe price has about 1.3 billion invested in emerging growth funds. the  investment firm\\'s orange county holdings include national education of irvine,  silicon systems of tustin and archive corp.  athey said a statistical indicator used by t. rowe price recently signaled that  many, small growth companies \"are grossly undervalued\" relative to historic  norms.  \"if the past is any indication, 1989 is the year that these stocks will do very  well relative to the rest of the market,\" athey said.  he said he is particularly bullish about small growth companies because many  economists and analysts are projecting that their earnings growth will outpace  larger companies in 1989.  winners and losers among county stocks
