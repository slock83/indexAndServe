All the notebooks are designed for a python 3.5 kernel.

Make sure you ran nltk.download() in a python interpret (not IPython !) and downloaded punkt and stopwords.

The latest working notebook is Index and query - mmap : [https://github.com/slock83/indexAndServe/blob/master/Index%20and%20query%20-%20mmap.ipynb]

It requires the reformatted data generated by data reformater.
